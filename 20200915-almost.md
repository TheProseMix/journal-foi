My last entry was short, but it probably didn't convey just how
depressed I've been lately. All last week, I kept to myself and said
very little. I figured it was the only way to survive. This past weekend
almost went off without an argument, but, right at the end of Sunday,
XXX started on me. I hadn't even done anything. She apparently doesn't
like me complaining about having no time, when she makes some time for
me. Some time. Right. Sure, a few hours, late in the evenings of
weekends, almost always without my laptop, when I'm barred from leaving
the flat. What exactly am I supposed to do in those hours? Fuck her.

Yesterday she was being super-nice. I don't know why. I can't deal with
her capriciousness. Yesterday I also had my appraisal, where I asked for
a promotion; I got very "it ain't gonna happen" vibes, but we'll see.
Also, mum hurt her head. I rang them up, because I'm obviously worried,
during which I was apprehensive about what XXX would say.

Everything is falling apart.
