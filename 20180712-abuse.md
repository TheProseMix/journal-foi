While walking back to the car, after XXX in the evening, XXX stopped
suddenly in front of me. I didn't have much time to react and said
something like, "Don't stop right in front of me." I didn't say it in a
harsh way -- in fact, I tried to make light of it -- but XXX came back
with, almost immediately, "Stop whining!"

I told her I wasn't whining, but she insisted otherwise. I didn't want
this to escalate into an argument, so I just dropped it. Perhaps next
time she stops in front of me, I won't have time to react and will walk
into her; if she complains, maybe I'll tell her to stop whining. Perhaps
I should tell her to stop whining whenever she whines -- which is pretty
incessantly -- about her XXX. I realise my issue was entirely trivial,
but my point was to avoid her harm more than anything else.

On the journey home, I was asked what exactly I had disinfected earlier,
after returning from the XXX, for her bizarre decontamination protocol.
I was honest and said the foot-well; I should have lied and said
everything, because apparently this wasn't enough and, because the car
was still a biohazard, I had to change my clothes again. I don't have
any more trousers, so was forced to work the next day in my shorts.
We'll be going to another XXX thing in the evening, so presumably I'll
be getting rather cold.

I've no evidence for this, but I'm increasingly inclined to believe that
XXX is undermining me on purpose, at this point. I can't imagine that
she is this irrational. If not purposely, then at least habitually.

Again, I was told to go to bed.
