XXX started her new job on Friday. It has made a marked change in her
mood and attitude. Surprisingly, it corresponds with a marked change in
my mood or attitude: I'd like to think it's empathy and reciprocation,
rather than the antidepressants. I'm happy for her and I'm pleased that
it's working out, so far. I'm proud of her for what she's accomplished
and I'm glad to be supportive. Long may it last.

On an unrelated note, I am really worried about XXX. I weighed him
yesterday and he hasn't gained any weight. He's really reluctant to eat
hay -- but he does occasionally -- and generally a bit down. I thought
it might have been because he was lonely and bored, but now I think he
has a dental problem, such that it's physically uncomfortable for him to
eat. Poor thing. I'm going to take him to the vet next week. I'll have
to do it relatively secretly to avoid upsetting XXX, but he needs some
professional care. During my recent working from home and leave days,
I've taken the time to play with him and try to make him feel loved
(which he absolutely is); he's come to trust me more, I think, and I
just want to help the little guy.
