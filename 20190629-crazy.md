She clearly didn't want me to join her XXX, in the evening.

I said many times I wouldn't be grumpy and wanted to play with friends.
I didn't mind what we played, I just wanted to spend time with people
whom I enjoy the company of. She couldn't understand this.

She conflated this with my opinion about XXX, which I hadn't even made.
I made no reference to XXX and felt it was a deceit to try and get a
rise out of me. She falsely accused me of being against living in XXX,
despite clearly being fine with it.

She seems to expect me to be black and white with regards to likes and
dislikes; I cannot be contextual. Who lives like that?

Apparently going through documents of our old place triggered her
"PTSD". I didn't ask her to do this; I can't predict what's going to
trigger her; I did plenty of work myself and it wasn't my idea to move.

In the end, I just let her go XXX alone, so I could chill out away from
her madness. I missed my friends and, in the end, they played a XXX I
would have enjoyed (she tried to persuade me that they'd be playing
something I wouldn't like).
