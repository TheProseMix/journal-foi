I had the contents of this all planned out in my head. They've been kept
there all overnight, because I couldn't sleep. I thought things were
going well and improving; we even sold our house, for God's sake.
Apparently this was too good to be true. I can't be bothered to write
out what happened. What's the point? Our house sale will complete on
Friday; I wouldn't be surprised if XXX emptied out the bank account and
disappeared the same day, at this point.

I'm not pressuring her to get a job. I've never done such a thing. I've
supported her for years; and I mean that in the sense of her well-being,
rather than financially (but I've done that too). The elephant in the
room, when it comes to our financial situation, which she is
oh-so-anxious about, is her lack of contribution. Get a grip. You're not
a child any more.
