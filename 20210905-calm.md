For the past fortnight, things have been surprisingly good. This last
week, especially. Almost no arguments and very little unnecessary
tension. It's like XXX's a completely different person!

I'm sure she's trying as well, but I'm doing a significant amount of
"management" to keep things civil. To be honest, whilst it's working,
it's quite hard work. On days when it doesn't work -- like today, for
instance -- it's exhausting. So far nothing untoward has happened, but
it's hard work and I feel like the peace could break at any moment. I
hope it doesn't and the following week continues pleasantly. Although
I'm aware that shark week is approaching, so all bets may be off.
