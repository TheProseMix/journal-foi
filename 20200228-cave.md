I had a dream last night. As I've said before, I don't think this is
some deep part of my psyche trying to tell me something, but it's
nonetheless something to dwell upon.

I was in a cave, which was imperceptibly closing in on me from above.
Say, every time you stopped to look, the ceiling had moved down a
little; gradually, maybe a centimetre every hour. If you get trapped in
that cave, it will slowly crush you to death, but it happens so slowly
that -- maybe because the cave is interesting to explore -- you forget
or become complacent. There will come a point, however, when the exit
becomes too small to escape from; when you wish you had done something
about it earlier. From that moment on, you know your fate, albeit are
perhaps unconcerned about its immediacy. Eventually comes the point when
the cave pins you to the floor, so you cannot move; it doesn't hurt, but
you're stuck. Then the cave starts exerting pressure upon you, gradually
becoming more-and-more painful. If you're lucky -- if you haven't
already gone mad -- the force will break something critical and you die
immediately. More likely, however, is that things start to snap and
puncture and squash over a prolonged period. You feel everything
fracturing and oozing out around you; fear, pain and panic would render
you unconscious at some point. Your mind gives up. Then you die.
