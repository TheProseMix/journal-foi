My new policy of information hygiene is proving hard to follow, in the
sense that it's counter to my usual way of talking. However, it's
definitely the right approach. For example, on Thursday we went out for
a walk in XXX and I commented on the planes. That completely innocent
observation turned into her usual diatribe about COVID and how the XXX
handling of the situation -- and the population in general -- is so
brain-dead.

Today I was going to call my parents and do some fact checking about all
the bullshit she was spewing on Thursday. Up until 3pm, while she was
still in bed, I was having a chilled out day and was totally up for
this. Of course, that all changed once she got up and I had to deal with
her. Now I don't feel confident to call mum and dad -- the risk of it
causing a fuss with her is too high -- and her presence over just the
past few hours has completely crippled me. I know I need to use my
limited time effectively, but when she has such a negative effect on my
status and happiness, then it's hard.

It's amazing how successful I am despite her. Imagine what I could have
achieved without her constant insidiousness. I live in a state of fear
and that's no way to be.
