Needless to say, the conversation about expenses went down very badly.
First there was the screaming [PP], then there was the question of how
it could be so expensive. I laid out the itemised bill for her. She was
shocked how much I had spent on lunch, even though it was slightly less
than her [EA]: It's true that eating separately was meant to reduce our
bill, but because I ended up (stupidly) going to expensive motorway
services, it came to about the same. Still, I don't see why I shouldn't
be allowed to spend as much as she does on food [-R;PP;EA]. In the end,
I conceded and split the bill vastly in her favour [EA]: she paid half
our joint cost and half her cost. I told her this was to "punish myself"
for spending too much. She said I didn't need to punish myself [+R], but
that my argument should be consistent. Fair. However, I ate extra
because I was unhappy; not because of her, despite her insisting that I
need to attribute blame somewhere while I was categorically ruling her
out [+-R]. She concluded that I must be unhappy because of work and the
drive, etc. [DR] and that I should do something to fix this [PP].

For this month, I'm going to spend very little. I need to lose weight
anyway. There will be a week when we're in XXX, where I won't be able to
get away with this, but then the bill at the end of December will be
obviously on her. I suspect she'll still have a go at me, for not eating
enough or some bullshit.

# XXX: Before, During and After (Unedited)

Wednesday

* Was annoyed [-R] by me being late due to traffic; once again brought
  up that I ought to change job [DR]. She wouldn’t accept that my new
  route was more stable than the last, but I can’t accommodate
  exceptional circumstances. I suggested skipping lunch (my me-time) to
  leave early; she was eventually persuaded [PP].

Thursday

* Had a go at me for spending too much on dinner [EA; see above], when I
  spent slightly less than she did. I’ll spend nothing from now on.
* She asked me about going to the therapist. I don’t know why I lied but
  I said that I didn’t; I think to avoid triggering her, or to avoid
  having to talk about it (because she’s quizzed me about it in the
  past). Anyway, she realised I was lying and, for some reason, let me
  off the hook [+R]. I felt guilt about it, as I should have, but I
  don’t know how she was able to guess. The least delusional answer
  would be that I have a tell of some kind and she’s picked up on it.

Friday

* First day trying leaving early; came home to masses of washing up and
  rubbish [-R]. XXX didn’t appear for another hour [PP]
* Snapped at me [PP] in restaurant because she took what I said about
  our misunderstanding of the menu to be a criticism of her; ignored me
  -- even avoiding eye contact -- for a while afterwards [PP;-R].
* Took so long packing, while insisting that she was about to use the
  bathroom so I couldn’t use it in the meanwhile, that I was unable to
  shave before holiday, despite saying I really wanted to [PP]

Saturday

* Left late waiting for her to finish packing
* She complained about the lateness of the airport bus, which was true
  but out of our control (and this not worth complaining about)
* Accused me of being distant in the plane [-R;PP]. I was trying to read
  and constantly being grabbed and interrupted isn’t very helpful
* Pressured into having dinner I wasn’t keen on [PP]

Sunday

* First thing, accused me of knocking her glasses on to the floor (which
  I didn’t) [PP]
* Took more breakfast than she needed, leaving much of it
* Threw towel
* Forced me to rush lunch [PP] so we could fit everything in; we had
  plenty of time
* Insisted [PP] we go to XXX, despite the extra driving [EA], because
  she’d otherwise be bored

Monday

* Took more breakfast than she needed, leaving much of it
* Threw towel
* Couldn’t find a launderette, so pressurised me to do it by hand [PP].
  Told her I wouldn’t do it, but just got yelled and swore at [PP],
  under my presumption that I’ll be doing the work (even though she said
  she help)
* Unwanted fish meze again [PP]

Tuesday

* Forced me to throw towel; countered with my commute [PP;DR]
* Very impatient [PP] in XXX, especially when navigating the XXX part
* When I wanted a particular meze for dinner, she wouldn’t join in;
  instead ordering loads of other stuff that she mostly didn’t eat (I
  ended up eating) [DR]
* She spent a lot of time talking to XXX organising board games for
  Sunday [-R]. That’s fine, but imagine what her response would be if I
  ignored her for a considerable amount of time while on holiday talking
  to a female friend (if I had any) [DR]

Wednesday

* Wasted breakfast again
* Using toilet paper like it’s going out of fashion
* Expected me to understand the bad GPS directions without seeing the
  map; got angry with me when I went the wrong direction [PP,-R]
* Got cake takeaway for dinner; she ate 3/4 of it [PP]
* She wanted me to kill a bug; she kept going on and on about this tiny
  thing. I didn’t want to kill it, just flick or blow it away; she
  insisted that I kill it. I tried to pick it up and, stupidly, said she
  was cruel. I don’t know why and I didn’t apologise without being
  prompted and, obviously that sparked an argument into the rest of the
  night [PP;-R]

Thursday

* Today was going so well, despite me accidentally reversing into a tree
  and us ending up driving 15km down and unpaved road in the middle of
  nowhere.
* At the hotel, she started screaming at me [PP] about the shower,
  because it was either cold, low-pressure, or both. I had to sort this
  out and, while I tried to work it out, so I could explain it to the
  receptionist, she got increasingly agitated with me. I hadn’t done
  anything wrong [-R]. I was trying to help and I just got screamed at
  over and over [PP]. This was completely unacceptable behaviour and
  killed the holiday for me.
* I wonder whether this was it because of XXX's post on Facebook, in
  which he and others rallied around the political left (obviously
  against her XXX vote)? The XXX ultimately won, so she’s happy to keep
  her job as the country collapses around her. In her own words, “I only
  care about me.”

Friday

* Was still grumpy in the morning, not unexpectedly.
* Made me carry her stuff all day [-R;DR]
* Went to various places for just a few minutes each; I felt like her
  PA/driver
* Eventually cheered up by the afternoon; mentioned at dinner that she
  is happy her friends are left-wing [+R], so yesterday’s outburst was
  solely on her
* Has been calling me names all week [-R]. I call her names back, but
  they’re beginning to get trying
* She assumed I’d be fine to return her XXX, when we got home, despite
  it meaning me being late for work [DR;EA;-R]

Saturday

* Not taking responsibility about breaking the toilet; accused me of
  making it worse [-R]
* Brought up house buying and pressurising me to find out about money
  from M&D, apropos of nothing [PP;-R]
* Couldn’t do anything for herself; I even had to feed her water
  directly
* I feel more like her PA than her husband: set a reminder for me for
  this, do that, etc. Do it yourself!
* On the plane home, for a brief moment, I forgave her in my head. I
  don’t know why. Needless to say, it only lasted until the next
  infraction.

Toilet: poop with the door open; stays in there for so long that it’s
sometimes like torture for me; also hypocritical, if she wants to spend
more time with me, then spend less in there! I’m always mocked when I
need to use the bathroom, so I often hold it.

Contrasts
* Clean XXX mountain and sea air vs. stinky XXX air
* Normal, friendly, generous, trusting people vs. XXX

Greedy
Wakes me up when I snore
Doesn’t listen to me; just responds with platitudes

Wednesday 18/12 (untagged)

* Demanded that I throw the rubbish away and did the laundry when I got
  home. That was after I had done some shopping, while she was out
  enjoying herself with friends.
* She’d additionally left me We a load of greasy washing up to do
* It was otherwise all fun and games when I went to find her and until
  we got back home, then she demanded again that I not leave my drink
  cans dying on the drying deck, because she had knocked them over
  earlier and it, “scared the crap out of her”
* I made a reasonable justification for putting them there (they need to
  dry before recycling, they otherwise might damage the sink, and I
  don’t want to get water everywhere by drying them on the side). She
  wouldn’t have it and made her argument at increasing volumes and,
  eventually, swearing and anger (“Put your fucking Coke cans on the
  side!”) I’m not gonna rise to that; the obvious report being that she
  could very easily put them in the recycling when they’re in her way
  (just like I throw all her rubbish away). I’m not crazy though, I want
  to sleep tonight, not argue over something so trivial.
* When I accused her of shouting at me (“being loud”, in her words), she
  said I’d been loud to her several times over the past few days. This
  isn’t true.
* Over 2 hrs later (just after 2am), she emerged from the bathroom with
  a more refined argument: that I had disregarded her feelings when she
  said she was scared by the noise. It’s true that I had originally
  dismissed her claim, because of the way it was phrased made it sound
  trivial, but “disregarding feelings” is a stretch. She reworded her
  statement and I then understood it as the noise made her jump; fair
  enough, I apologised for this eventually. Most of the night however
  was spent trying to contain her unreasonableness. During this
  late-night argument, several things came out which are worth writing
  down:
    * She asked me if I would talk like that to any of my friends, I
      said I probably would, because I didn’t think it was harsh or
      unfair, etc. She then claimed that this is the reason I have no
      friends. That was unfair. I don’t have close friends because I
      don’t have time to foster them, because I spend almost all my
      non-working time (even some of my working time) on her. She
      claimed that this is why all my friendships collapse. Also unfair
      and quite ironic: The only friendship I’ve had that collapsed was
      XXX (which she mentioned), but that — by anyone’s standards — was
      an unexplainable outlier. Ironic because her friendships collapse
      all the time, largely because she makes that happen. (I didn’t
      mention that.)
    * She claimed that whatever XXX had told me, with regard to
      communicating with her better, wasn’t working and even making
      things worse. In reality, I’ve actually applied his advice very
      few times, because the situations haven’t arisen. If there’s been
      a change, it’s a coincidence. Either that, or spending time with a
      normal person has helped me to see just how dysfunctional our
      relationship is, and I’m subconsciously challenging that. That’s
      just a theory of mine, but it’s interesting to see the push back.
    * The main argument descended into a sequence of sub-arguments. My
      way of resolving this is to tackle each sub-argument as it comes,
      or descend into the next if it occurs, and work my way up the
      stack, leaving no loose ends. This doesn’t seem controversial to
      me, nor like a bad idea. XXX didn’t seem to understand this and
      appeared to get very confused, dotting around between arguments
      which I was in the process of defending or had already
      justified/resolved. Sub-arguments were always brought up by her;
      it seems dismissive for me to ignore them, if they were important
      enough to bring up in the first place. I can’t say if she was
      actually confused, or doing this on purpose to try to cause
      confusion; to give her the benefit of the doubt, I would say that
      she probably didn’t care about the sub-arguments, so the
      importance of the main and upper arguments, to her, caused her to
      drift back.
    * She claimed that I was disregarding her feelings (that was her
      main argument). I eventually countered this with what I had
      thought earlier in the night: she was disregarding my feelings and
      time with all the chores she had left me (I didn’t put it as
      bluntly as that). She didn’t apologise or thank me once for all
      that I had done. She didn’t get this argument at all, and instead
      made it about her and the specifics of my analogy (to the effect
      of “if you want me to work full time, I can either eat out —
      costing us money — or make lunch, without the time to do the
      dishes”. I work full time too.)
* In the morning, all was apparently forgiven. However, one of the first
  things she asked was to again be her PA — to make her look like she
  was at work — while she went back to bed in the morning. I’m trying to
  do my own work, which has significantly fallen behind; partly because
  of these kinds of requests. (I have to fulfil, otherwise I’m likely to
  incur more wrath.)
