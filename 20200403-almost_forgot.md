There are some important episodes that I forgot to retell in my previous
entry. There may be others that I've forgotten/repressed, but these are
particularly stark:

1. XXX was annoyed at me for having to have prescription medication and
   the difficulties that entails with regards to its collection.
   Specifically, being able to acquire it without having to go to a
   pharmacist and, what she calls, my "laissez-faire attitude" about
   having stocks. Let's not forget that said medication is due to her;
   in fact the doctor suggested to me that I should remain on it while
   my "external stressors" are present. Anyway, I managed to get more
   stock and get it delivered within a few days. I apparently needed
   minding while I went to collect it, apparently requiring to wear what
   amounted to a makeshift hazmat suit, but that was otherwise
   uneventful.

   What I'm annoyed about is the paying for it. It required cash and I
   didn't have enough; I was happy to go to the ATM, but XXX insisted
   that she'd pay. That was kind of her, but it had the knock-on effect
   of her arguing with me that I never have cash. Whatever. Her point
   isn't invalid, but it didn't warrant a fight. The real kick though is
   that I had to pay her back. That, too, is fine, but it really
   underlines the imbalance. Firstly, I don't feel it's right to have a
   go at me when I'm paying her back for medication I need because of
   her; secondly, when she needed medication, I both got it for her and
   paid for it myself -- why wouldn't I? -- and then she didn't even
   take it.

   I understand her reluctance to go out at the moment, but if it were
   the other way around, I would go to the pharmacy -- and pay -- no
   questions asked, for her in a heartbeat. That's what loved ones do
   for each other.

2. She shouted out in her sleep the other night. She used to do this in
   XXX and it always made me jump. This was the first time I've heard
   her do it in English and it still made me jump. "It doesn't fucking
   matter!" she shouted. She would never use that kind of language or
   tone with any one other than me, so I think it's reasonable for me to
   conclude that she was having a fight with me in her dream. That's how
   she sees me. I didn't press the matter, of course, because she was
   aware of it and it was clearly a tripwire waiting for me.

3. She keeps complaining about using surface wipes, particularly if I've
   done something that she feels needs her to decontaminate. However, at
   the same time, she'll use two for every XXX component she drops on
   the floor (I've learnt to be super-careful about this, myself, which
   is quite stressful) and two-or-three to wipe down the table before
   XXX. I don't see how this is necessary. She's trying to keep her XXX
   in pristine condition, for resale, but there's a limit! Also, I can't
   imagine all the chemicals that are in Dettol wipes will do her XXX
   much good.
