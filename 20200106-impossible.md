Yesterday evening, XXX started once again whinging about XXX and XXX's
behaviour on Facebook; the former, specifically, but the latter by
association. I just switched off -- like an out-of-body experience --
and agreed with whatever she said. It was easier, that way. I don't
fully agree with her, but whatever. It's clear she doesn't want to
maintain the friendship and that she can't see past her own narcissism.
Facebook is a toxic place for such people.

In the end, she decided to block them completely. I was "asked nicely"
(i.e., forced) to do the same. I'll miss XXX and XXX -- they seemed like
good people -- but I need to maintain my sanity. Needless to say, I
further resent XXX for controlling my friendships.

On a different note, she is becoming increasingly impossible to live
with. While she'd be the first to say otherwise, her consideration of me
has declined to the point where I'm like her slave. She expects me to do
almost everything for her. She tells me she's blocked the toilet in the
middle of the night, rather than unblocking it herself. She crashes
about, with all the lights on, while I'm trying to sleep. We play XXX
after endless bloody XXX. We eat out almost exclusively now, usually
somewhere she wants; I feel like I haven't eaten healthily for weeks.
When I work from home, I'm expected to do things for her rather than
work.

Like I say, I've had enough.
