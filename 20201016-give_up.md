I haven't written much, lately. This doesn't mean all is well. I've just
lost the energy to write down every last infraction. Being forced to do
things against my will; the constant narcissism, neediness and what
comes across as goading, trying to make me trip up, so yet another fight
can ensue. I just don't care any more. I've lost my life.
