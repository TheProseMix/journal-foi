I'm growing increasingly anxious. For the past week-or-so, I've been
waking up quite early in the morning and been unable to sleep. I have
this strange feeling in my chest. Very occasionally, I have suicidal
thoughts.

I need to see a doctor, but I cannot. I've been trying to get
appointments when I can get away with going in secret, as I don't want
to reveal my condition to XXX (as it will trigger her, plus a doctor's
visit will involve the usual stupid decontamination routine and probably
a subsequent argument).

I'm stuck between my wife who's incredibly high maintenance and my job,
wherein my new boss is also very high maintenance. Plus, going home to
my parents' puts me in the middle of trying to please everyone: I don't
want to take advantage of their hospitality, and while XXX also doesn't
want to do this, her natural self-centredness makes her blind to this.
Plus there's all the stress that comes with moving, which I didn't
really want in the first place.

I can't cope with this for much longer. I'm upset and have no one to
talk to without compromising one-or-more of my "masters". I've
checkmated myself. I can't do this :(
