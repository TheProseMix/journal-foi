I knew a week almost without incident or tension was too good to be
true. I don't know why I got complacent. Of course a fight started over
nothing. As always, she makes me feel like nothing. Like I just want to
crawl under a rock and die.

To be honest, I doubt I'll even need to wait on her threat of murder.
She's pretty much killed every part of me already.
