I really don't understand. The beginning of last week was a nightmare;
horrendous arguments on three days in a row, then not much better
thereafter. However, yesterday, she was fine; fun to be around. We had a
good day. Even today -- despite the tension from the delivery fracas,
amongst other things -- was reasonable. I don't get it. Why is her mood
so unstable?

One of the other things was getting my letter from my XXX: They got back
to me to say they could do so, but only if I get a blood test. They
actually came up with a reasonable compromise: they run a drive-through
blood testing service. The problem is it's in XXX -- a 120 mile round
trip -- and there's a fuel shortage. Even without the fuel problem, I'm
sure it would be ruled out. Sigh.
