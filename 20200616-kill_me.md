On Sunday, at 6pm, after having a good afternoon playing XXX with XXX,
XXX spotted a conversation I was having with mum. She asked about it and
I told her: mum had sent me some chocolate in the post, nothing more.

This started an argument that went on until 4am, admittedly with about a
three hour interval when we watched TV and she went to the bathroom. The
next day, on very little sleep, the argument resumed; from about 11am to
around 3pm. It just never seemed to stop. The few times I thought it was
over, it just sparked again and again and again. We agreed that we both
had work to do and would try talking it out calmly at 7pm. Amazingly, we
managed that. It was awkward and very nearly descended into chaos again,
but -- despite a few potential flares later that evening -- it finally
ended.

12 hours of solid arguing. Just because she hates my parents so much.
I'm writing this now, the day after, and still have a headache. The
argument was mostly not about my parents, but that's all it took to set
it off. Earlier this afternoon, my office chair was delivered: I
objected to XXX's quarantine protocol and, again, she started shouting
at me for no good reason. I decided to channel my negativity into
destroying the box which my chair arrived in. After 12 hours and when I
thought things had settled down, I see once again how thin the veneer
is.

I can't handle this kind of treatment. A few days of serenity followed
by an insane period of horrific argument. Sparked by nothing. I never
instigate these arguments, it's always her. I'm stupid enough to keep
them going -- I'm trying to stand up for myself -- but I don't
understand why she believes this approach is productive. I don't
understand how -- after countless times of me telling her -- this can
help our fragile relationship.

Now I'll try to be brief:

* She is still upset at mum and dad because of what they said.
  * Mum and dad have apologised, but she doesn't buy it. She assumes
    that the apology is from mum alone (as that's who sent the e-mail)
    and that dad is still culpable. She doesn't think mum's e-mail is
    sincere.
  * I have no reason to doubt my parents' sincerity and try to make that
    clear. She believes I'm "defending them". I'm not; I'm just trying
    to be objective, to show that there are subtlties that she has
    failed to recognise.
  * She refuses to recognise these things and stubbornly sticks to her
    dislike of my parents, particularly dad. She thinks they're both
    "against her" and that we "gang up on her".
* Hence, when I'm sent chocolate from mum, she presumes it's for me
  alone; i.e., confirming her prejudice. I actually don't know if it's
  intended for me alone, but I doubt anyone -- my parents included --
  would send such a gift and not assume it was to be shared.
* By virtue of me talking to mum and not telling her about it, she
  concluded that I was going behind her back. I wasn't. It was a two
  sentence conversation with mum and I've got better things to do that
  divulge my every communication. If there was any shred of going behind
  her back it's that, the last time mum sent us something -- that cake
  -- she insisted on it being thrown away.
* She didn't accept that I hadn't gone behind her back. However, to
  follow that, I simply described -- as I have done previously -- that
  the only reason I say and do things "behind her back" (which is not
  how I would characterise it) is because she actively prevents me
  saying or doing what I want. Don't get me wrong, if she justified her
  reasons and convinced me otherwise, in a calm manner, I'd of course be
  open to persuasion. However, forcing me -- by yelling or on pain of
  argument -- with sometimes no justification whatsoever, pushes me to
  take matters into my own hands.
* I proceeded -- this is probably this mistake I made -- to enumerate
  the major instances of her doing this to me. There were a number of
  arguments we had when we were first in XXX, together, which were quite
  hurtful (one was being forced to eat something I didn't want, the
  other was her instance that I couldn't be a XXX to sustain her
  lifestyle), however the actual first thing that instigated this
  behaviour is when she forced me to end my friendship with XXX. That
  caused me to "go behind her back" when talking to other friends;
  notably XXX, whom I was also ultimately forced to cut ties with
  (albeit less actively than with XXX).
  * I referred to this as "controlling behaviour", which she
    understanably took objection to. She insists that this wasn't
    controlling and that she had good intentions. Those being, with
    regards to XXX:
    * She felt she was prejudice against XXX people.
    * She felt that her attitude (i.e., being quite suggestive) was
      dangerous for our relationship.  Her "good intentions" therefore
      were to end the friendship to avoid damaging/destroying our
      relationship. She claims that she tried to convince me at the time
      -- she did, but in an aggressive and argumentative way, and I
      didn't buy it -- so her only other option was to forcibly kill
      it... How is that not controlling behaviour?  How is that not her
      problem, feeling threatened by someone else, rather than trusting
      me? This is not what I told her -- as this argument had already
      gone on too long -- but it is what I believe.
* She later started using my argument against her against me. She said
  that she felt forced because of what I had said in the past. For
  example, it's already well-established that she thinks I forced her to
  find work. Now, on top of that, she thinks I forced her to stop
  talking about people we knew in XXX because I mentioned it a handful
  of times.
  * For the work thing, I don't think I mentioned this more than a
    handful of times. XXX herself agreed that it was no more than five
    times, separated by days or weeks. I fail to see how this
    constitutes coersive control (she didn't call it this, because I
    don't know if she's familiar with the term, but she alluded to it).
    I never wanted to force her to do anything and, in the intervening
    years, I've apologised for this profusely. However, regardless, five
    times would barely count as "nagging".
  * When we were in XXX and XXX, there was an XXX guy with whom we
    played XXX with. I noticed that she mentioned him quite often -- but
    I never for a second thought it was because of any nefarious reason
    -- I was just intrigued, so asked. Apparently she took this again as
    me forcing her to cut ties with this person and never mention him --
    nor other friends -- again. What the actual fuck?
  * Her final example was when I mentioned (once) about her going out
    for dinner with her friend, XXX. Again, I'm actually fine with this.
    The only reason I mentioned it is because she insists that men and
    women can't be "just friends" and so I was intrigued by the double
    standard. Again, she felt forced and hasn't spoken to this guy
    since, apparently. More so, she insists that my memory of her
    maxim is missing a condition; that it should be, "men and women
    who are attracted to each other can never just be friends." Two
    things:
  * Firstly, I still insist that this is utter bullshit. People have
    boundaries and generally respect them and each others. If two
    people are attracted to each other, but are in relationships
    themselves, then most of the time -- I believe -- they will
    respect the relationship. Don't get me wrong, I realise that it
    can and does happen, but I don't think it's a sure thing. Not by a
    long shot.
  * Secondly, I never forgot this extra condition. It's an invention
    by her made up almost on the spot (it took her a few minutes to
    "remember" it). I've had to live by this rule of hers for years; I
    wouldn't forget it.

I accept that her controlling behaviour may have had good intentions
and, indeed, was not meant to control at all. Intentions are important,
after all. Only after I said this did she reciprocate with how she was
characterising my "forcing" her to do things as her misunderstanding my
intentions. We agreed -- the only productive thing from this fight --
that, in the future, if either of us feel pressurised by the other to do
something, we need to immediately and civilly say as much, with the
expectation that the "forcer" will explain his/her intentions and a
compromise can be reached.

Obviously, as I said, this failed immediately when I had to fetch my
chair. A chair that I'm not allowed to sit on for 11 days because it's
in her -- expert in virology, that she is -- stupid quarantine.

God, my head hurts :(

*EDIT* I forgot to add this summary, which has been stuck in my head now
for a few days:

* While "controlling" and "manipulative" may not be the right terms,
  something is not right with XXX's behaviour.
* It's clear that she can't take criticism nor accept responsibility.
* She's definitely narcissistic, or at best self-centred.
* She sees things in black and white and is uncompromising, unable to
  listen to reason to change her opinions.
* She has an anger management problem.
* She needs me more than I need her. Who will do all the chores, etc.
  that she clearly doesn't want to do? I feel that the "arrangement",
  where her parents contribute a significant proportion to any future
  house purchase, is just a way to force me into servitude; like she's
  buying me as a slave. Well, I'm not for sale.
