I'll let the recording speak for itself.

I don't go around trying to offend anyone, let alone XXX. If she's
offended, I'm sorry, but that's her problem. I asked the doctor whether
it was OK to halve my anti-anxiety medication. I told the doctor that
XXX was a bully. I don't want to waste their time, but I need help to
get out of this.

After the recording, she started having a go at me again, in the middle
of the night. Then she seemed friendly and agreeable, until it came to
lunchtime, when she got short-tempered again. Like I say, it's just a
veneer.

I've had enough
