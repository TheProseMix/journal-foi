Over the past few days, XXX has been complaining that she is bored. I
sympathise, because there's not a lot we can do when we're shut up in
our flat because of the virus. Although, to be fair, we don't need to be
shut up quite as tightly as XXX believes, so that's point one in, "She
only has herself to blame."

Point two is that, while I sympathised with her, I suggested that
boredom is a state of mind (this is true) and that one can find
something for themselves to do. Sure, I didn't say it would necessarily
be easy to find something worthwhile -- although even the search is
better than nothing -- but apparently that approach wasn't appreciated.
Apparently it's "impossible" for her to think of something for her to
do, beyond playing XXX. Indeed, it's apparently so impossible, this is
the reason she went crazy when living in XXX.

It's a good thing she has something to do to occupy her during the day.
Oh, but wait, she said she didn't need to work. That's right. Presumably
that means she would be even more bored otherwise! Of course, I didn't
point this out to her; she would lose it and the whole thing would turn
in to a fight. However, I can't help but find her hypocrisy amusing.

In the meantime, she's suggested things for us to do. I don't have a
problem with that, but I suspect that if I don't engage with absolute
passion, then I'll be again blamed for not being able to keep her
entertained.

She is like a fucking child.
