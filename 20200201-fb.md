She's deactivated her Facebook account again. Yesterday evening, she
told me to like her profile picture. I don't get it. First she
pressurised me into something, then she deactivates. Whatever.

Today she's playing games with XXX over video-chat. I got to sleep for
ages, which was good. Tomorrow we're going to XXX again, whether I like
it or not... Yesterday, she played with XXX and XXX over video-chat; she
didn't finish 'til 8pm but asked me to come home early. I had to miss
much of drinks and nibbles for this and we had to have Japanese curry,
rather than what I wanted to cook for dinner.

Now I'm stuck at home while she plays games. I'm not really free to do
whatever I want.

*Update* Apparently now I have to go to XXX to pick up even more crap
for her. I'm like her god damn slave.

*Update* On Saturday, I think it was, she openly admitted -- in a
discussion about "XXX couples" -- that I was forced to play. Her very
words. I even joked that I should have recorded it; fortunately she
didn't take it the wrong way (I'm not sure she heard, to be honest).

Again, on Saturday and Sunday, my headaches returned while being forced
to play XXX. The same kind of headaches as last week; apparently
resistant to painkillers.

Lastly, I noticed that, as well as seemingly constantly deactivating and
reactivating her Facebook account, she actually has another account,
named "Butcher". I don't know what she's up to.
