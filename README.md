# Cleartext, Redacted Journal

I'm releasing my journal in cleartext, with sensitive information
redacted. I fear, if anything were to happen, my story would otherwise
be lost. (The encrypted, unredacted copy still exists, will full Git
history for provenance sake.)

It will take time to sanitise everything. I'll start from the most
recent and oldest, releasing the backlog slowly, but surely.
