Another weekend. I was left alone for much of Saturday, thank goodness,
while she played endless XXX with her friends. She uses my laptop, which
leaves me with little to do, but the peace is welcome.

Sunday was less peaceful. She played XXX with her friends in the
afternoon, then we watched TV. At around 6pm she asked what to do next;
I replied that we should continue watching. Long story short, what she
meant was that I must start making dinner. Remember her lecture on
speaking directly and double standards? It all seems quite hypocritical
when you look back on it.

Anyway, I made her ladyship dinner. She claimed if she had it too late,
she'd end up going to the bathroom late and therefore going to bed
really late, which I was against. She can go to bed whenever she likes,
as long as she doesn't wake me up. As for the bathroom, there is no
earthly reason why she stays in there for so long. That is her choice.
It's nothing to do with me. If she wants dinner earlier, then maybe she
should make it herself, or at least help clean up so it doesn't take me
longer than it needs to.

I've noticed a curious pattern. First comes, for example, the above:
uncompromising demands, on pain of her unjustifiable wrath, that I must
submit to. This is followed by her being "cute" and affectionate.
Usually at this point, I'm pretty pissed off with her, so she turns this
against me, "Why are you being so distant?" and the like. Maybe if she
weren't such a psychopath she'd understand.
