XXX has been such hard work, this week. The week prior was relatively
calm, even by our standards, but obviously it's shark week so that means
unreasonableness -- more so than usual -- with at least a week of this
left to endure. Great.

I've mentioned this before, but it feels like she's goading me a lot of
the time. I've come to recognise it, so I try not to fight back; I know
how to deal with bullies, it just takes me a bit to realise that's the
situation. It helps, in that it keeps arguments from spiralling out of
control, but it's no good for my mental health: I just have to suck up
her bullshit. I notice increasingly that my hands are shaking and I've
developed a bit of a stutter whenever I talk to her. I'm terrified of
her. I haven't meditated for a while now: I'm clearly not the problem,
despite what she insists, but how she makes me feel doesn't help me help
myself. She's just dragging me down.

Let me recount two particularly ridiculous "problems" she had this week:

1. A while back, XXX mistakenly didn't shut the freezer properly and it
   started to defrost. That's fine: it's an easy mistake to make -- I've
   done it -- and I certainly don't hold it against her. It was an
   accident. Nonetheless, I thought it was a good idea to get a fridge
   and freezer temperature monitor. It was finally out of "quarantine"
   this week and I went ahead to install it.

   She gave me a hard time about this. Mostly, not unreasonably, about
   her concerns over the batteries leaking or exploding. I think that
   risk is incredibly small, but I'm not going to argue with her.
   However, she said one thing that was quite telling. That she "let me
   get it", but it's a shared space and she doesn't want it in there.

   She "let me get it"?

   I can get whatever I want. Sure, I buy that there's a risk and I'm
   fine with deferring installation until we can put the sensors in a
   container, but I'd rather not destroy our "shared space" because one
   of us didn't shut the door properly. Given her ridiculous
   self-isolation and quarantine rules, she's the one who's going to
   suffer if the fridge breaks down and all our food goes bad.

2. This morning, I poured myself some water and refilled my ice tray. I
   then refilled the water filter jug. It takes a bit of time to filter,
   30-40 seconds, but that was apparently a huge problem. She had
   apparently filled the jug for herself the night before -- which she
   couldn't have done a good job of if there wasn't enough water for one
   glass and a bunch of ice cubes -- neglected to tell me that she
   wanted first dibs on it and, when she was inconvenienced for those
   few seconds, had a massive go at me. "You're so selfish." "You're
   always stealing my water." "You never refill the jug." etc.

   I actually always refill the jug. She rarely does, but claims to
   always do it. Also, I can't read her fucking mind -- not that I would
   want to learn the shit going on in there -- so how am I supposed to
   know that she wanted water first. I don't have a problem with her
   going first -- if I had known, I would have gladly waited -- but to
   give me such a hard time, over literally nothing, is ridiculous.

   Fortunately, I got much of this recorded, so there's evidence of her
   lunacy. She insisted we get a second jug. Whatever, bitch.

Other than that, it's just her usual bullshit. Her never-ending
one-woman crusade against the XXX, or the "propaganda machine" as she
calls it. Her obsession with local flooding, even though we live part
way up a hill near no significant water sources. Let's not get into her
usual crap about COVID.

I don't know why I put up with it. She's hurting me. Abusing me. I make
mistakes, sure, and I've done things against her when I've really felt
trapped, but I'm trying to do the right things. I'm not a "selfish,
territorial monster". She needs to take a good hard look at herself.
