In the week where the relationship with my parents and brother became
(temporarily) strained, because they (completely reasonably) find the
situation I find myself in difficult to comprehend, my workplace has
instigated a new mental health service. I have taken the opportunity to
make the most of it...

My message, on 24th March:

> My wife is paralysed by, what I guess you'd call, "health anxiety";
> this has been acute during the pandemic. This manifests itself in
> extreme control and the inevitable stress when her constraints cannot
> be met. This is excised over me, in particular. To give her the full
> benefit of the doubt, I would say that she's trying to keep us safe

> if I were to openly flaunt any of this, it would have dire
> consequences that I cannot personally cope with. Her anger is
> particularly bad: it can cause arguments that go on through the night

> hard sell for her to accept any that's given)? Thank you.

The reply, on 25th March:

> You don't say so in what you have written here but I find myself

> Was she similarly anxious to control not only hers but your activity

> It's impossible for me to know what's going on with your wife so I'm

> Some of the things that really worry me about your situation are

> * Forbidding you to leave the house. This is unreasonable behaviour

> * Sustaining an argument all night so that you cannot get any sleep.
> * Her violence, which is currently aimed at furniture but what about
>   if you decide to stop accepting her unreasonable behaviour?
> * Not allowing you to see family and friends.
> * Threats of self-harm if you won't comply
> * Your wife's refusal to seek help. Why is this? Presumably, because

> I'm concerned for your safety. Does anyone else in your network

> I hope that helps.

(Note: My message is quite one-sided and I try to be as brief as
possible, so it lacks nuance. I hope to expand on the points made in
subsequent sessions...)
