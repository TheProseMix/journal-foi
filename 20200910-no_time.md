I don't have time to write these any more, but plenty of shit's happened
in the meantime. Every bloody weekend some pointless fight rears up: her
birthday weekend; last weekend; today and the palaver regarding updating
the smoke alarm (one would think we were preparing for the zombie
apocalypse). I've given up. I just don't care any more.
