# An Update

I haven't written anything here for a while. After our big bust up over
the summer, and eventual reconciliation, I felt it prudent to avoid
writing everything down as it acts somewhat like a positive feedback
loop. In the meanwhile, we have moved to XXX and our house in XXX is in
the process of being sold. Given the downsizing, I have had to cast off
many of my possessions, regardless of how much importance I imbue to
them; while XXX has done similar, almost all of my stuff now fits into
one large suitcase, in contrast to her many boxes.

The past few months have had their moments, but in general, things don't
seem to have improved. One could attribute this to the stress of moving,
but I think it runs deeper than that. XXX is just awful.
