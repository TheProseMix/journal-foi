# "Biohazard"

I had to go to the doctor's this morning, because the XXX wants another
blood test and, having moved to a new area, the GP needs to be kept
aware. It was a straightforward chat at 8:30 in the morning. Of course,
on returning, I once again had to wash all of my clothes and shower, as
though I as contaminated with smallpox.

Interestingly, I went to the doctor earlier in the week to register (as
did XXX, the week before) and apparently this didn't warrant her
decontamination protocol. Of course, when I went to the hospital a few
weeks ago, that required the full nine yards.

Frankly, I feel like I now only want to see the doctor if I absolutely
have to; either that, or visiting them secretly. I've tried to keep my
hospital appointments secret in the past, but I've never managed it
because they take so long and are regular enough to keep track of; I
don't think it will be any easier to keep GP appointments a secret.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not denied access to healthcare, but my life is
made more difficult because I have to deal with either XXX's ridiculous
paranoia about contamination, or deal with the fallout if I try to stand
my ground. It's like living with Howard Hughes! She's supposed to be a
scientist: What happened to extraordinary claims needing extraordinary
evidence?
