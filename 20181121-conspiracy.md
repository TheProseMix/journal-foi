# Conspiracy Theory

This is a "conspiracy theory" in the sense that it's a post hoc
amalgamation of anecdotal evidence, rather than anything concrete. I
don't believe it, personally, but you must admit it makes for a
compelling narrative.

* I am the principal breadwinner and, up until quite recently, was
  responsible for paying most of our costs. This has become less acute
  over the past year-or-so: XXX has been quite fair when it comes to
  paying for outings and the like, especially paying me back for her own
  personal expenditure. I still pay the majority, however.

  In a means tested sense, this is fine. It's not that I have a problem
  with sharing my wealth to support XXX. However, I feel that I ought to
  have some say into where our money is spent. Currently, I have at best
  a token voice: I can make suggestions, but they are almost always
  dismissed. Often, in fact, with an air of disapproval that can easily
  boil over into an argument; to such extent that I will try to avoid
  this if possible.

  I have no savings and cannot buy things for myself. I'm not a material
  person, so I don't have much in the way of wants, but I will often
  check myself when I consider buying something, no matter how
  inexpensive -- do I really need that? XXX doesn't follow this model
  and often buys wastefully. She has the luxury of savings and leeching
  off her parents and basically living her lifestyle at others expense.

* I have to work, to maintain our lifestyle. A lifestyle, as I suggest,
  that I have little influence over: When I want to do things, they are
  often dismissed; instead, I have to do what she wants to do, largely
  because she can't do these things without me, or needs me to drive her
  (making the argument that the bus would be more expensive or
  inconvenient). I potter along as I want an easy life; there is a big
  overlap with the things she wants to do and my interests, so it's not
  a particular hardship, but it's very much for her benefit rather than
  ours. Anyway, my rambling point is that she monopolises my free time
  for her own ends.

  To extrapolate this, she even goes so far as using my time from work;
  I often have to work from home or even take annual leave for her
  benefit. This has been particularly keen over the past year-or-so and,
  I feel, it has compromised my position at work to the extent that I am
  just a filler. I don't have any evidence that I'm considered redundant
  or replaceable, but I feel this (fortunately it's not like management
  is effective in this regard). Despite that, increasingly my morale has
  been worn down because my time and usefulness is depleted by her
  needs.

* With regard to doing things she can't, this covers a multitude of
  things and, by in large, she can do them herself; she just "doesn't
  want to". I don't particularly want to, either, but they need to be
  done and it's best to just do them rather than letting tasks languish
  and get worse. It really irks me when I'm asked to do something she
  could easily do herself. Of course, if I were to bring it up, an
  argument would ensue.

* The people with whom we associate -- I can't say, "are friends with",
  realistically -- are also largely controlled by her, through doing
  things that she wants to do. Indeed, whenever we encounter someone she
  really takes objection to -- for whatever reason, even if I'm not
  involved -- the associated activity will be permanently ruled out.

  Anyway, because of my lack of time, I'm not able to socialise. Not
  that I really like socialising, but I don't like being alone either.
  In the very few instances where I've started to make friends, the
  situation has been steered by her such that relationships cannot
  flourish unless she approves of them.

* Occasionally I will try to stand up for myself. Unfortunately for me,
  this usually manifests itself as sarcasm or passive-aggressiveness,
  which is great for her because she can fight against that rather than
  my actual message. She knows I hate arguing and conflict and will
  almost certainly yield. I feel like, if things don't go her way, she
  uses this as a weapon to control me. Not only does it win her the
  argument, but it undermines my self-esteem.

  She is clever and can outwit me quite easily. She often misinterprets
  what I say and turns it against me, which makes things even worse:
  this is arguably my fault for not being clear, but I maintain that
  most people aren't clear in the moment and that the exact words of
  what I'm saying are not as important as the subtext that I'm (failing)
  to communicate. (Bear in mind that communicating effectively is a
  function of tiredness; when I'm kept up later than I'd like, this is
  perhaps an obvious consequence.) She knows I hold logic above a lot of
  things, so when she sees a flaw in my argument -- even if it is just
  through bad wording -- that becomes the new fault line. Such arguments
  spiral out of control until we're fighting at 2am about the semantic
  differences between words.

To summarise, my conspiracy theory is that XXX is trying to control me
by removing my means to protect myself: be that financially, in terms of
time and energy, socially, and by attacking my weaknesses (specifically
my self-esteem, feeling of purpose and cultural values). It works out
pretty well for her, in the sense that I become more-and-more compliant;
like she's slowly grinding me down into her servant.

Like I say, there is no evidence of these observations being
intentional. They may not even be more than noise, amplified by my
personal biases. Nonetheless, these events have occurred -- and continue
to relatively regularly -- so you can presumably humour me.
