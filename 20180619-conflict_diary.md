# Conflict Diary

Whine; don't bring XXX; impatience

## Monday, 18th June, 2018

* While at work -- having suffered through a weekend of XXX's
  impatience, short temper and the resulting lack of sleep -- XXX asked
  me to sort out theatre tickets, which she believed she'd be entitled
  to a discount on (because of memberships, etc.) Firstly, there's no
  reason why she couldn't have sorted it out: in the past, I've done
  this because I can phone for free; XXX can now also do this. Secondly,
  when it turned out that the theatre wouldn't accept the discount, she
  kept pressurising me to find out the information required (it's her
  membership, so she'd be in a better position to do this); her asking
  turned very much into demanding. After wasting a lot of time and
  getting increasingly annoyed with her attitude, it transpired that her
  discount was indeed invalid. I managed to reserve good seats -- even
  that wasn't good enough -- but because of the full price, she decided
  we can book it for another day, sometime later. What a waste of my
  time.

* When I got home -- having left a bit early, because I know she wanted
  to go the another XXX thing as soon as possible -- I made dinner.
  While it was cooking, I threw out what was left of XXX's old hay
  (mostly just the dust) and replaced it with the new stuff I had bought
  earlier. I mentioned this, at dinner, and XXX exploded. I was
  completely in shock, such was the unexpectedness and triviality, and
  didn't know what to do. Her argument was that she fed him just an hour
  before I returned and that I had undone all her work; whereas the
  reality was he was running low on crappy hay and I just topped it up.
  Because of my surprise, I could not communicate this clearly, so
  things just escalated. I was scrambling just to keep my head above
  water. Then her argument -- although she clearly didn't believe my
  clarifications -- hinged about how it wasted time. It was not until
  much later (when we were driving to the XXX thing) that she had calmed
  down enough to listen to what I was actually saying: I did this while
  dinner was cooking and thus no time was wasted.

* Once again, I find it ironic and hypocritical that she can make a time
  wasting argument, when she wasted -- albeit unintentionally; but then,
  I obviously didn't do this intentionally to waste her time! -- so much
  of mine; and not just today. Part of her argument also revolved about
  my apparent mercurialness when it came to wasting resources: I had
  mentioned on Sunday that we should have got a bigger plastic bag for
  the shopping and she took this as me wanting to save the grand total
  of 2p. No, I just want to use less plastic, which I've mentioned
  before. The amount of hay I threw out was trivial and would be worth
  nothing.

* In the past, I've been more accommodating of her status and have,
  retrospectively, been kind when writing up our conflicts. Not this
  time. This was completely unfair, out-of-the-blue and
  disproportionate. It's not my fault that her XXX -- something she
  chose to do -- is hard. Given the timing, I think it would also be
  fair to mention that it's not my fault that she cannot control her
  emotions at this stage in her cycle. It is, however, largely her fault
  that I'm currently working almost every waking hour and getting around
  five hours sleep, per night. It is her fault that I'm not able to
  commit myself to anything at work and, thus, not achieve or advance.
  It is her fault -- not mine, as she keeps insisting -- that bought a
  house in XXX: She pressured me to buy a house we couldn't afford (and
  hence pressure our families for support); she wanted to move to the
  area for her XXX; she's the one who does absolutely nothing to help,
  either in terms of chores or simply herself, in light of her clear
  mental health problems. This really is the last straw. I've been
  trying to search for things, over the past few days and weeks, to
  avoid separation. I've done everything I can to help. I get nothing in
  return.

* I'm continually investing into our relationship, without asking for
  anything in return. I'm hoping that my sacrifices would be seen as
  endearing and encourage her to reciprocate and also invest into our
  relationship, causing it to grow. Alas, instead, she just takes
  more-and-more.

## Weekend: Saturday, 16th June -- 17th June, 2018

* While I avoided any conflict over the weekend, I only did so through
  skill (i.e., in recognising the signs) and never-ending work. There
  were a few close calls, while XXX was being short tempered, for
  whatever reason, but they didn't amount to anything.

* I spent all of Saturday cooking, gardening and cleaning. After all
  that, we went to XXX for XXX. The discussion arose of where we should
  eat: I said I didn't really want to go to the usual suspects again and
  suggested some alternatives, which were immediately dismissed. Out of
  the two usuals, I then picked one and then that too was dismissed. If
  XXX has such strong opinions about where she wants to eat, then don't
  bother giving me the illusion that I have a choice.  Thereafter, we
  stayed at the XXX thing really late, to compound my tiredness.

* On Sunday, after we had a day out, I did the cooking and cleaned the
  bathroom, which I didn't have time to start until 9pm. As such, I
  didn't get to call my parents. I'm not sure why XXX couldn't have
  cleaned the bathroom, given it's mostly her mess, or how she believes
  that playing XXX for hours on end in any way adds value to our home
  and lifestyle.

* XXX mentioned that she was anxious, yet again, about her XXX.  I did
  my best to support her. She also said that she was anxious about going
  back to XXX -- in the sense of being with her mum and doing
  administrative things with little-to-no benefit -- I can sympathise
  and help insofar as I'm able, but she started making demands on me
  being with her for a prolonged time and working from home, while in
  XXX.  These aren't things I want to do, because they're very awkward
  for me; she made me (in the sense of avoiding an argument and ruining
  the day) say that I would do these things for her. Maybe I should
  start making unreasonable demands of her. How about even reasonable
  demands like cleaning up after herself?

* Anyway, I didn't have any time to rest over the weekend, or even do
  what I want. I am exhausted and have had enough.

## Sunday, 10th June, 2018

* The weekend had largely been OK. However, on Sunday morning, while we
  were preparing to go out to somewhere that needed cash, XXX gave me a
  hard time about not having any. This is despite me saying that I would
  get some the day before and she telling me not to bother, because she
  had loads. Fortunately, I managed to nip this in the bud quickly and
  we got on with the day.

* It occurred to me on the drive home that, when we've had a fun day, I
  tend to forget -- or, at least, forgive -- prior conflicts. I am too
  forgiving, I think; there are some things that XXX has said that have
  really crossed the line. It also occurred to me that ending our
  relationship is really going to hurt her: I don't want to hurt her,
  but it's not fair that I should take the full brunt of her abuse. The
  argument, I suppose, is that in the long run, it's better off, but I'm
  so torn.

## Friday, 8th June, 2018

* Apparently, I'm not even safe from XXX's relentless aggression while
  I'm at work. The text messages, continuing yesterday's theme, started
  arriving in the late morning. I was in a meeting, so couldn't respond
  to them; so then came the inpatient queries as to whether I was
  receiving her messages. Of course, my attendance at the meeting from
  that point was reduced to zero, given that her antagonism diverted my
  attention completely.

* Let me copy and paste the first two messages:

    * "I gave some thought to this. I think we'll be grateful if your
      m&d can pay off your student loan, which will help us to move out,
      which is the first step; but I want you to confirm with them that
      we still need them to help with the deposit when it comes to the
      second step of buying a place."

    * "need them to help with the deposit" = "need the money from
      grandma's house to help with the deposit". If we can confirm this,
      w'd be grateful to accept their help with your student loan."

* It goes on and on like this, but the theme is clear: XXX's gratitude
  for my parents' financial assistance is conditional. Not only that,
  but she will claw back anything and everything she can, largely by
  cajoling me into doing her bidding. That's not going to work any more.
  I said what I could to support my argument and manage her expectations
  -- it didn't do much to help, but at least in writing I can defend
  myself better -- at the expense, yet again, of my productivity and
  happiness. I understand that she is stressed by her XXX --
  self-inflicted -- and anxious about her future living arrangements --
  also self-inflicted -- but that's no reason to take it out on me and
  to have such unreasonable expectations of others.

* I'm going to have to pick XXX up from XXX later. I'm going to have to
  spend all my energy on pretending to be happy, to avoid yet further
  conflict. I can't take this any more.

## Thursday, 7th June, 2018

* We went out for dinner again, which isn't a problem -- plus it meant
  not having to go to a XXX evening -- and while we were talking, XXX
  mentioned that I was, "an interesting person to talk to." As though
  this was some revelation. This just goes to show how little she knows
  me; I'm presumably just a servant to her.

* Anyway, the above didn't cause any hostility -- I just felt it
  important to mention -- but later in the evening, I mentioned how my
  parents had suggested that our bathroom door could be one of the
  things that get fixed for when we sell our house. She took this to
  mean that it must be fixed and the whole thing blew up in my face.
  Ultimately, it came to light that she was still annoyed by the
  financial support mum and dad have tacitly offered.

* The whole argument revolved around, in my opinion, her extreme
  ingratitude. To give an example: Mum and dad gave use XXX towards the
  deposit of our current house; apparently, she doesn't tell her friends
  about this because "it's such an insignificant amount". That is, she
  is ashamed or embarrassed. I am frankly aghast at this attitude. It
  may be a cultural thing, but that doesn't make it any better. XXX is
  a lot of money and, in my honest opinion, any help -- even if it were
  one penny -- I would be grateful for. I don't understand why XXX
  believes that my parents have some infinite supply of money or that,
  if they have some, why we are entitled to all of it.  They have to
  live, too. I appreciate that her parents are making efforts to provide
  support for us -- which I'm very grateful for, of course -- but I
  don't see how that implies reciprocity. I do a great deal of work for
  XXX's benefit, she does very little/nothing for me. She goes on about
  fairness all the time; perhaps she should look at herself, first.

* Anyway, I eventually managed to placate her by reassuring her that my
  parents, while they do change their minds on details -- which is
  allowed -- and that, when they don't have all the information, they
  come across as a bit vague, they do honour their promises and they
  have promised to help. I don't know why I have to make this so
  explicit for her and, frankly, it's academic at this point: Whether my
  parents promise to help, or not, I'm not going to allow XXX to leech
  off my family. It's bad enough that she does it to me and enough is
  enough.

* Interestingly, in all this, there's no mention of her personal
  contribution. That's not to imply it's zero -- she does pay half of
  the mortgage -- but without a salaried job, and under her presumption
  that she won't get one (that she wants), it's almost as though she
  expects these external contributions to compensate. Given how unstable
  and stagnant her behaviour makes my contribution (i.e., I can't
  advance in my career while I'm spending almost all of my effort on
  her), that doubles the problem. Of course, she would never see it this
  way.

## Wednesday, 6th June, 2018

* To help me deal with the conflict from yesterday, I overindulged in
  comfort food at lunchtime: ice cream, chocolate, cakes, etc. It
  obviously didn't make me feel any better; I think it's more that it
  gives me a sense of having some kind of control of my life, however
  illusionary. I had vowed to be "extra good" this month, but that's
  broken down less than a week in due to the harassment I have to
  endure. In the past, I've even resorted to alcohol to help me through;
  fortunately it never lasted long enough to become a problem, but
  that's largely because I don't like the taste. Still, eating junk food
  isn't healthy, either.

* I was slightly late into XXX because of this (by 7 minutes) and XXX
  was texting and even trying to call me, by this point. I don't know
  why she's so needy. Every time she says something which she expects me
  to reciprocate and I don't (usually because I didn't hear it), she
  gets defensive.

* When we got home, I started cooking dinner. XXX wanted asparagus, so I
  started cooking them. She asked whether I'd washed them, which I had,
  but didn't believe me. It's true that I only gave them a quick wash,
  but she kept insisting that I hadn't done anything. I kept reiterating
  that I had and eventually she said that she'd trust me. Of course,
  seconds later, she was accusing me again and ultimately concluded
  that, if she has some subsequent digestive problem, then she would
  hold me to account. So much for that trust.

## Tuesday, 5th June, 2018

* Over the past few days, XXX has been increasingly argumentative and
  short tempered. I believe this is because her period is approaching
  and that she's working on her XXX. However, given my sacrifice over
  the convention weekend, she has been making an effort to be nice and
  to even help out, occasionally. It's often minimal and quickly turns
  into getting me to finish whatever it is off, but it's better than
  nothing. Nonetheless, the short temper is looming and it's not long
  before her demanding, exploitative and argumentative streak starts to
  show.

* This all came to a head today. First off, in the morning, I needed to
  use the bathroom and while I said I was going to -- not that I want to
  announce such things -- she insisted that I didn't and gave me a hard
  time about it. Firstly, I don't see why she has priority over me.
  Secondly, it's weird that I have to announce it in the first place;
  particularly so because she jokes and mocks with me at the same time.
  If she makes me feel ashamed or embarrassed to use the bathroom, or
  actively blocks my access, then it seems likely that health problems
  may develop in the future. As such, I hold her fully responsible for
  these.

* At dinner time, she was argumentative regarding the scope of the
  changes/improvements needed to our house to make it more attractive
  for sale, particularly how much ought to be spent. The tension was
  pretty clear at this point, so I didn't raise any objections and tried
  to change the subject.

* Then, in the evening, when we were playing with XXX, I said -- in no
  way meaning to be offensive -- that she was occupying a lot of space.
  To be fair, she had cleaned out XXX (mostly), and was now playing with
  him. I too had contributed to cleaning -- and do most days -- but was
  forced to do so in a limited space, because of where she was sitting.
  Rather than seeing this, she just sat in the way. In retrospect, I
  could have been more assertive about asking her to move temporarily,
  but given her earlier and usual poor temper, I didn't want to
  potentially start anything. Nonetheless, my comment started things
  anyway and a full blown argument blew up. I just gave up, to be
  honest. The argument went on until late in the night and while I
  sort-of defended myself and tried to explain things -- as usual, she
  had misinterpreted my meaning -- it wasn't worth my energy. I can't
  even be bothered to go into detail now, I'm just so sick of this.

* What's more, while we were arguing, we were still stroking XXX. He
  didn't like XXX's loudness -- neither do I -- but what was
  particularly irking to me is that, when XXX went to stroke him, she
  was really rough.  She's often a bit rough and she says that he likes
  it; I'm not so sure, but either way, this time was way too much. Poor
  little thing.  One point of my argument was that she takes out her
  aggression on whoever's around; she didn't think so, but I think XXX
  feels otherwise.

## XXX Weekend: Friday, 1st June -- 3rd June, 2018

* The night before we went to the convention, XXX complained about XXX
  being smelly. He's a rabbit and lives in our living room; if you want
  to keep a rabbit in a living room, there are certain compromises that
  you're going to have to accept! She kept complaining about it and told
  me to clean him out. I don't know why she couldn't clean him out,
  besides her laziness.

* As I say, the last thing I wanted to waste a weekend on was a XXX
  convention. As suspected, I didn't enjoy it, but XXX deigned me the
  freedom of skipping part of the Saturday to spend time with my
  parents, which I definitely took advantage of. She mentioned (and this
  isn't the first time I've heard this) how happy I seemed to be seeing
  them, like it was surprising. I haven't seen them since Christmas and,
  largely due to her, am usually limited to any access at all. It's also
  interesting to note how happy I was once I had my freedom, even though
  it was only for a few hours. I had such a good time with my mum and
  dad; I really miss them.

* Upon returning to the convention, I found XXX for dinner. She, for
  some reason, has no stamina and so was extremely hungry. We joined the
  queues for the food trucks and the one I chose served me first. I
  returned to her and she proceeded to eat my dinner. I offered her a
  bit, to keep her going while in the queue, but she just ate it all.

* We stayed at my parents overnight. However, we got there so late that
  there was no opportunity for interaction. In the morning, we awoke
  naturally and left as soon as we could; there was very little wasted
  time, in my opinion. Nonetheless, we got to the convention quite late,
  thus missing a large part of it. That was my fault, apparently.

* (Mum also talked to me about helping out with my student loan. I don't
  feel she has to, but she was being generous and even said there was
  more to come. XXX was in earshot of this and later told me that this
  wasn't going to be enough and it wasn't what we need. I changed the
  subject as quickly as I could, but mentally note the ingratitude.)

* Given that I didn't want to be there and XXX was clearly in a bad
  mood, I was effectively dragged around for the rest of the afternoon.
  It had its moments, but wasn't particularly enjoyable as I felt like I
  was treading on eggshells for much of the time. In the end, I offered
  to stand in the Bring and Buy queue, which was rather long, for her,
  just so she could see what she wanted without wasting more time and so
  I could have some peace.

## Observations

* It has occurred to me that, by recording only the bad things, this
  litany sounds as though everything is awful and I'm not making any
  effort in trying to improve the situation. That is, I'm as culpable as
  XXX is. It's worth pointing out, however, that days that are not
  recorded here are either neutral or (occasionally) even good. The
  problem I have are these horrendous arguments which seem to build up
  and explode periodically, largely because XXX's approach to arguing is
  to become extremely aggressive (i.e., to push her viewpoint), whereas
  mine is to become extremely defensive and submissive (i.e., to get out
  of the argument as soon as possible, even if it means giving up on my
  opinions; which of course establishes resentment). This is not a
  healthy approach to conflict, but as XXX in completely uncompromising
  and I am so passive, it's probably inevitable and definitely
  unsustainable.

* It's also worth mentioning that our arguments are often comorbid with
  situations where we're not operating with full lucidity. I am
  particularly guilty of this when I'm tired or have had a boring day at
  work (and hence feel tired, even if I'm physically awake) -- the
  former, it's worth noting, is largely a result of the punishing
  demands pressed upon me -- while XXX is particularly guilty of this
  during her period (about a week before to a week afterwards) and when
  she's subject to external stress and, especially, criticism (e.g.,
  related to her XXX). I have tried and failed to mitigate my tiredness
  problem, but I have just so many chores to do, as XXX does so few, as
  well as constraints imposed by her. As such, I can't do anything I
  want to do and haven't been able to for a while. As for XXX, obviously
  she cannot control her hormones and I sympathise inasmuch as is
  reasonable, but it's interesting to me how other women aren't so
  affected. Maybe there are some, but 1/8th of the workforce aren't
  missing/unapproachable at any one time; so I believe XXX is in the
  minority and I feel that her response is governed by her general
  narcissism.

* This diary suggests that XXX's attitude is basically parasitic, which
  may come across to a casual observer as harsh and unsubstantiated.
  Since the beginning of this year, I have been recording time and money
  flow in our relationship for evidence's sake. As for money, our usage
  is evenly split, whereas our input is about 3:1 in my favour. This is
  understandably, albeit not desirable, as XXX has no/minimal income; in
  the past, she was somewhat excessive with her spending, but has lately
  tempered this to a more manageable level. However, time is a
  completely different situation: On average, I put in an order of
  magnitude (60x) more effort than she does, while she consumes over
  twice as much as I do; so two orders of magnitude difference. In my
  opinion, she has no excuse for this either: She's doing her XXX, but
  I'm doing a full time job. To give some examples:

    * We're now going to XXX events at least three times a week.  I
      don't really care for XXX, but it keeps her happy (i.e., an
      instance of where she gets what she wants) at the expense of my
      time (i.e., for what I want). What's more, these events come with
      expenses, particularly the cost of transport, entrance and eating
      out. Who eats out every other day!? It costs a lot, of course, but
      this is manageable; but I love cooking and now I'm not able to. On
      the days that I'm permitted to cook, it has to be simple things,
      otherwise I get criticised and blamed for having dinner too late.

    * On Wednesday, 30th May, we went out for dinner as we often do,
      nowadays. What was rare was that XXX paid for this, for which I
      thanked her. (It's worth noting that I'm never thanked for paying
      for dinner/anything.) She, however, said that I could repay her by
      paying for the XXX expo tickets; an event I didn't particularly
      want to waste a weekend on. This is a textbook example of the
      asymmetry: I'm grateful, while she just expects things.

    * The money situation with my parents is becoming increasingly
      stressful for me. XXX expects my parents to contribute to any
      future living arrangements we have, simply by virtue of her
      parents making such an offer. I don't expect anything of my
      parents and, to a degree, don't even want their help: I'm 36, I
      don't want to go crying to my mum and dad every time life isn't
      fair! Don't get me wrong, if they offer their help, I will not
      turn it down and will be exceedingly grateful. The point is, that
      it's not expected. XXX wouldn't even be grateful. In fact, she's
      even said, if it's not enough (i.e., under some arbitrary limit),
      she will not be pleased.

    * In the run up to us selling our house -- one of her batshit insane
      ideas to get out of XXX -- it's apparently up to me to put in all
      the effort of making the place more attractive to buyers.  Because
      she wants to do her things on weekends -- which I must facilitate
      -- it means I'm forced to spend bank holidays and even annual
      leave to claw back some time. While she will do literally nothing
      to help, she also has very strong opinions on what should be done
      and how it should be done, which I must follow to the letter (even
      if it's physically impossible) or risk causing conflict.

* It's perhaps worth mentioning that, while XXX has completely fallen
  out with her XXX -- something that, in hindsight, was inevitable given
  her inability to accept criticism, no matter how justifiable -- she
  chose to do this and I have done everything I can to help her achieve
  it.  Everything from proof reading to sounding out research ideas to
  hearing her bitch about her supervisor's comments. I have never stood
  in her way and actively encourage her, when I can. On the contrary, I
  am doing a job that I was basically forced into doing to maintain her
  lifestyle: When we first married, I mentioned that if I couldn't get a
  XXX position, I wanted to pursue my XXX ambitions. I was categorically
  told that I couldn't take up such an "unstable" position. This is just
  a particular example of her exploiting my passivity and pushing her
  own agenda.

    * On a related note, while I don't like what I do, I am good at it.
      However, XXX won't even let me do that, such that I can't progress
      or accomplish anything. Keeping me tired completely ruins my
      productivity and the regular working from home days that she
      forces me to take, for her benefit, just make matters worse. No
      one respects me -- or even likes me -- at work and I achieve
      almost nothing. It's really surprising that I haven't been
      disciplined for this, to be honest.

* Every now and again, I get the opportunity to interact with other
  people (i.e., not XXX or my colleagues) and it often surprises me how
  friendly and cordial they are. It's like I'm so far removed from
  normal human behaviour that encountering it is almost shocking to me.
  I'm happy that I'm able to reciprocate -- in the sense that I haven't
  lost this skill -- but it's sad that it's such a rarity.

* I realise that recording all this may come across as deceitful and
  vindictive. One may even argue that it's thus a foregone conclusion
  that things will breakdown. Maybe. I'm trying as hard as I can to keep
  my head above water, while avoiding conflict; that in itself requires
  a lot of effort, I don't have much left over to actively progress our
  relationship. XXX's effort, however, is minimal; it would be unfair to
  say it's zero -- I have noticed distinct improvements in her behaviour
  -- but by in large, her self-centredness and pride gets in the way of
  making sustainable gains.

## Monday, 28th May, 2018

* I was pressurised into doing more gardening on the bank holiday. I had
  agreed -- albeit reluctantly and largely for a quiet life -- to do
  this, but because I had done so much the previous bank holiday, I
  didn't know what else could be done. I made it clear that there wasn't
  much left to do, but XXX started to lose her temper and become loud. I
  just backed off and resigned myself to some peace and quiet in the
  garden.

* I asked her what she would be doing all day; not meaning it to imply
  that she wasn't pulling her weight, but she took it that way. I
  managed to persuade her that wasn't my intention; surprisingly she
  accepted this without further conflict. For what it's worth, she spend
  some of the day doing her work, she helpfully went shopping --
  although I had to pick her up and she took so long that it would have
  probably been quicker for me do to it myself, as I had originally
  proposed -- and played XXX in the afternoon. I dug the garden for over
  four hours. Still, like I say, it was peaceful.

## Sunday, 27th May, 2018

* In the night, XXX suggested we slept in the same bed. Something we
  haven't done consistently since around September. The reason being
  that our bed is too hard and it causes me to fidget, which affects
  XXX's sleep. Anyway, knowing this, I tried very very hard to be still
  and I did a pretty good job; ironically, it was XXX who fidgeted the
  most.  Nonetheless, she told me off when I made the smallest of
  movements.  Ultimately she gave up and said that I should go back to
  the other room. I was fine with this because I had been largely awake
  most of the night to maintain my stillness. After this, we both slept
  better and there didn't seem to be any tension between us because of
  the initially-rough night.

* Otherwise, Sunday was quite a good day. However, when we came home,
  the empty promises of intimacy were made and ultimately came to
  nothing. I don't really care about that; I'm rather used to it and,
  besides, my head hurt at the time. Nonetheless, just before we were
  about to clean out XXX, I was asked whether I had changed her sheets
  yet. XXX likes to have her sheets changed after I've been in them,
  which I find rather insulting. She apparently believes this isn't
  insulting, but frankly I'll be the judge of that. I don't know why
  exactly she could change her sheets herself, but to avoid unnecessary
  hostility, I just went up and did them before doing XXX's weekly
  deep-clean, late into the night. XXX watched TV for much of this.

## Thursday, 24th May, 2018

* While I was trying to give XXX his medicine this morning, XXX came
  down and said she wanted to go to XXX in the morning. That's fine, in
  general, but what about XXX? He's not 100% and, I felt, someone should
  be home to make sure he's OK. (I have to work and provide taxi
  services for XXX; otherwise I would happily have stayed home, which I
  secretly ended up doing.) What's more, if she went in the morning,
  he'd be alone for 12+ hours. I also said that I didn't need an
  audience while I was trying to give him his medicine. Anyway, needless
  to say, this all blew up horribly.

* She took what I said to be in a harsh tone -- it wasn't; I just care
  about XXX's well being. I care about XXX's too, but surely one day
  isn't going to kill her! -- and that I had patience for XXX, but not
  for her. Given how much of her shit I put up with, I think it's
  demonstrably clear that I have plenty of patience for her.
  Nonetheless, whatever I said didn't do anything to calm her. As I
  mentioned, I had a syringe full of medicine in hand and wasn't in a
  position to try to placate her with a cuddle (although I did offer).

* This bullshit continued and escalated. Nothing I could say made things
  better. I was merely trying to suggest that XXX needed someone to keep
  an eye on him and that I was nervous administering his medicine.
  Eventually, after a lot of shouting from XXX, she accepted this.
  Although it took a lot of grovelling from me to try to apologise for
  what she thought was hostility -- it's really difficult to apologise
  for something that's not your fault and imagined by the other party --
  and concede to being wrong (I wasn't). She simply misunderstood me, as
  she often does, and chose to react to it as hostility rather than
  giving me the benefit of the doubt: Why would I induce such a
  situation on myself? It's hard for me -- anyone -- to speak so
  non-fluently and be direct and unambiguous all the time; she told me
  to "shut up if I can't"! She insisted that I started the argument (it
  takes two to argue); maybe she should shut up if she feels so offended
  by some imagined hostility. Personally, I don't think I was being
  critical; however, regardless, criticism isn't a bad thing and if ones
  ego is such that it blinds you to advice, then that says more about
  them than it does anything else.

* Anyway, I then accidentally suggested that XXX might not be better
  yet. This set her off again and she cracked into tears and waling
  about how she can't continue with her writing. I realise this will
  come across as unfeeling, but she really needs to get a grip. The
  world doesn't revolve around her and yet, in something she has quite a
  lot of control over, she still isn't satisfied. I'm writing this after
  the fact, so my anger has cooled off a bit, but I was so furious this
  morning after her little tantrum. I've really had enough.

* Anyway, I took her to XXX and went to work. I'm responsible for my
  pets -- XXX isn't just a play-thing -- so I secretly came home at
  around 3pm to check on him. He'd eaten all his hay, which was good but
  also it meant -- had I not returned -- that he'd not have had any more
  until we got back from yet another stupid XXX evening, some six hours
  later. This is just like how she treated me when I was back from
  hospital, last year: I was on my own and scorned for inconveniencing
  her. I managed, because I'm an adult and can look after myself
  (something she clearly can't); but XXX's just a little bunny. He'd
  probably have been fine alone, but I'm not going to take that risk.
  Needless to say, when we got back home, he had completely finished his
  secret second helping of hay and was patiently waiting for more.

* Incidentally, while at home I ate ice cream. This is something I only
  really do under extreme duress and, for the past six months or so,
  I've been really good with regards to my diet. I even joined the gym
  and had planned to go, today. XXX is largely responsible for me
  gaining weight and losing my fitness, ever since we've been together.
  (Work is also partly responsible, but arguably I'm doing what I do
  because of her.) I've tried really hard to undo this, this year, and
  made considerable progress; I hope this doesn't break all my effort.

* I'm omitting a lot while writing this because, frankly, today's
  conflict was too painful and I'm completely wiped out. XXX says her
  XXX is stressful; if she really wants to know stress, she should try
  spending time with herself. I was on the verge of tears for much of
  the day; when I came home to secretly take care of XXX, I wanted to
  call the Samaritans, just for someone to talk to, but I didn't have
  the time; I even considered telling XXX, so he can understand what I
  can only imagine looks like a significant dip in productivity and
  attendance.

* In the evening, we went for dinner and XXX. As usual, she was greedy
  and impatient, by ordering quite a lot, which took a while to arrive.
  Then, of course, I had to pay for it all. As I say, I was wiped out,
  but was just quietly compliant. It's all I can really do to keep safe.
  I've noticed an odd effect though: When XXX starts complaining about
  one thing or another, usually trivial things or stuff where her
  narcissism is compromised, I mentally shutdown and find myself like a
  detached, nodding dog, just agreeing and sympathising with everything
  as I'm expected to. I'm still listening, but it's a weird, exhausting
  and even dehumanising feeling.

## Wednesday, 23rd May, 2018

* Today XXX went to the vet for neutering. I went first thing and was
  frankly worried about him all day. I didn't tell XXX how the vet said
  the procedure was "risky"; just because I know her imagination gets
  the better of her. Anyway, we didn't really get into a proper
  conflict, but she was argumentative all day. For instance, while she
  was working, I attempted to make light conversation with her -- to
  cheer her up a bit -- it was met with a stern, "I'm working here!" The
  hypocrisy is palpable: If I were to do that, when I'm busy, I'd get an
  ear full of abuse. I backed off, for my own safety.

* XXX has been tense, short tempered and argumentative all week. Every
  night, when I go to bed, I do so angry or upset. I don't know why this
  week has been so bad: her XXX thing is basically done and term has
  ended, so she has no more supervisions. Her XXX is under her control
  and, frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about with her getting
  so upset over it anyway.

## Tuesday, 22nd May, 2018

* I left work slightly early today, to get some food for XXX. I got
  stuck in traffic for ages and almost didn't make it to the shop before
  it closed. Then, on the way to XXX, I got stuck in more traffic. When
  we went to have dinner, there were problems parking -- difficulty
  gaining access, a sign on the ticket machine that said they only took
  cash (which actually turned out to be wrong) and the worrying antics
  of a homeless person -- all in all made me a bit upset. I think it was
  reasonable for me to be upset and I expressed this fairly evenly;
  however, XXX saw it otherwise and suggested that I calm down or that
  we even went home. She said I was scaring her. I feel this was an
  overreaction. It's like I cannot have opinions or express any form of
  negative emotion around her.

* Anyway, I chose not to go home -- I hadn't just gone through all that
  for nothing -- and we went for dinner. However, the restaurant XXX
  wanted to go to on Sunday, which I said we could visit today, was
  again unexpectedly closed. This upset XXX because she was looking
  forward to it. That's understandable -- although, again, she somewhat
  overreacted -- but I managed to calm her down. We went to another
  restaurant and that too was closed -- fortunately she saw the funny
  side in this, by this point -- and, on our third attempt, we finally
  had dinner. After all that, everything seemed OK.

* Then it came, as it does daily, to clean out XXX. Again, XXX lazily
  sat right in the middle of my way and played with him, while I did the
  work. I'm used to this kind of shitty treatment, but XXX was
  misbehaving a little bit and XXX tried disciplining him. I suggested
  that he's just a little bunny and that he doesn't really understand.
  XXX insisted that her anthromorphisation was valid -- not that she
  sees it that way -- and, God help me, I tried to rationalise with her.
  Needless to say, this didn't go down well. Ultimately I realised the
  error of my ways (i.e., having an opinion different to her own) and
  backed off, to finish cleaning up XXX.

## Sunday, 20th May, 2018

* Again, following yesterday, XXX was short tempered. As I say, no real
  argument manifested itself on Saturday. However, I feel the momentum
  of that tension boiled over into Sunday and it was just a matter of
  time until it sparked. And spark it did; over such triviality.
  Specifically, while walking back to the car -- having had, actually, a
  pretty fun day -- XXX started complaining that her stomach hurt and,
  of course, the reason was that I was walking too quickly. It's regular
  that she blames me for walking too quickly; I don't feel it's
  appropriate for me to apologise for this, just in the same way as it's
  not right for me to accuse her of "walking too slowly". Anyway, I
  slowed down and that seemed to cure her pain, but not enough to get to
  the end of her temper. Apparently I should have anticipated this
  problem (her words) and not walked so quickly in the first place. When
  I told her that it was physically painful for me to walk slowly --
  which it actually is, for some unknown reason -- she derided me.

* Later at home, it was chore time. Specifically, my time to do chores;
  a lot of them. XXX had promised that she would help -- although this
  only amounted to her promising to do a 10 minute dust -- but
  ultimately she didn't even do that. I did two loads of laundry, the
  lawn mowing, cleaned the inside of the car (for her), cleaned the
  bathroom and finished off the dinner. She did start making the dinner,
  to her credit, but left the mess and the stirring and serving to me.
  It very much seemed like she expected me to do things around her.

* Later on it was XXX clean out time. I did this, again, as it was the
  big, weekly full clean. Usually XXX helps by taking XXX to the kitchen
  and making sure he's OK. Today, she got bored of that pretty quickly
  and proceeded to watch TV. Later she picked him up and they watched TV
  together. Not ideal, but fine; nonetheless, I was still expected to do
  everything. Moreover, I was expected to do everything without
  infringing on her space; I was really tempted to say "You should have
  anticipated that your foot would get swept if you stand in my way
  while I'm cleaning up", but thought better of it!

## Saturday, 19th May, 2018

* XXX apparently bit XXX, this morning. I say "apparently" because
  firstly, I don't believe he did it on purpose (or out of spite, at
  least), and secondly, it doesn't sound like it was a proper bite; more
  like a nibble. Nonetheless, if it hurt, it hurt and I don't contest
  that. However, as a result, XXX was short tempered and irritable for
  the remainder of the day. I bore the brunt of most of this, but she
  was particularly standoffish with XXX when cleaning him up.

* Before that, however, we attended the XXX Food Festival. This was a
  bit crappy and I wasn't happy with the amount it cost. I didn't
  complain about it and I paid for almost everything willingly, but I
  was clearly a little grumpy. To be fair, this was largely due to how
  rubbish it was, rather than how expensive. Nonetheless, this set XXX
  on edge even more and she reflected it back on me.

* One instance was particularly noteworthy. XXX suggested that we could
  have a store at the food festival, because the others weren't anything
  special, where she would make something and I could be the money guy.
  I suggested -- probably stupidly -- that it would be better if I was
  the cook and she did the money, given her lack of culinary skill. (I
  didn't put it like that, obviously.) Anyway, this was actually fine,
  so she suggested we could sell "our brownies". I said they were "my
  brownies", not meaning anything by it other than I know the recipe and
  would be the one making them -- I challenge her to name one
  ingredient, or even how to turn the oven on! -- but this did not go
  down well. She countered this with, "XXX is my bunny." I didn't react,
  for safety's sake. For what it's worth, XXX is her bunny in the sense
  that she went crazy one day and smashed up the bathroom until she got
  her own way (that being, getting a bunny) and that she paid the
  majority (but not all) for him. However, I pay for almost all the
  sundries and food, plus do the lion share of cleaning up. Like I say,
  I'm not crazy, so I didn't point this out!

* Anyway, as for XXX, I had to clean him up entirely in the evening.  I
  usually do this, so it's not a problem, but XXX not only didn't offer
  to help, but was actively obstructive: sitting in the way and refusing
  to cooperate. That just made my life harder. Obviously I know better
  than to challenge this, so it didn't result in an argument, but living
  under such duress isn't fun.

* As an observation, it's also worth pointing out that, under this new
  "spontaneous, do anything XXX says, overly-keen XXX playing" regime,
  the quality of our life has taken a dive. For example, the house is
  often a mess as I don't have time to clean it -- and, of course, she
  isn't going to do it -- or there's no food left in the fridge, etc. In
  fact, it's quite often that I'm not even given the time to brush my
  teeth; I have to either postpone it to the next day or just skip it
  entirely. The rare opportunities in which I have some free time are
  "spent" by XXX, getting me to do bigger chores (e.g., the gardening).
  I understand that my way of doing chores could be seen as a bit
  regimented (although, to be fair, it's not like it was inflexible),
  but it's better than living in squalor.

## Monday, 7th May, 2018

* After working very hard all day in the garden, as XXX had requested, I
  began cleaning XXX out in the evening. I was clearly exhausted, so
  wanted to do it quickly; which I did, while she continued playing with
  her phone. This wasn't a problem -- although I wasn't very happy with
  her attitude, but I've got somewhat used to it -- but when I was
  almost finished, she wanted me do leave his water out so she could
  play with him. (Incidentally, she hadn't played with him much all day
  and, indeed, neglected to give him enough food. He had been patiently
  waiting for some time, which is another reason why I started sorting
  him out early.)

* Anyway, I like that she plays with XXX and have no intention of
  stopping her doing so, but she's clumsy with the water and often gets
  it everywhere, which leads to extra work for me. I didn't want this,
  so suggested that it just go back inside and we'd be done for the day.
  She pushed back.

* Fortunately, at this point, I was so physically tired that I could
  barely stand, so this served as a perfect excuse to back out of yet
  another stupid/pointless argument. Still, the fact remains that while
  she lounged around expecting things to just happen, some of us were
  actually putting the work in that counts.

## Sunday, 6th May, 2018

* Once again, XXX suggested that I wash my hands to her arbitrary
  standard. I have no problem washing my hands when I need to -- and in
  this instance, I needed to and, because I predicted that she would
  want me to take extra care, did so twice -- but one has to draw the
  line somewhere. Unfortunately, I responded to her request with
  sarcasm, which never makes things better. This is just habit and
  cultural and I personally don't feel I need to apologise for it; as
  I've said to her many times, "Why would I intentionally cause conflict
  when it's something I normally actively avoid?" For once, this
  argument actually had some (albeit not much) purchase.

* Anyway, her argument ultimately boiled down to fairness. She had
  washed her hands three times, therefore I too should wash my hands
  three times. Presumably, if she has washed her hands in bleach 50
  times, I would also be expected to do the same in the name of
  fairness. It's almost mind-boggling how she uses fairness as her
  argument, given how little she contributes. Obviously I knew better
  than to bring that up!

* I wasn't going to mention this, but the reason for the hand washing
  was for intimacy. Obviously the argument killed the mood, but then
  later on, she insisted we give it another go. I gave up initiating sex
  years ago, because I realise it's a waste of my time and effort; the
  rejection and disappointment was bad for my self-esteem. Like I say,
  it's amazing how unfair her idea of fairness is!

## Friday, 4th May, 2018

* After dinner, which XXX eventually joined me for after finishing her
  XXX, she seemed a bit down and said it was because of having to come
  back home. I encouraged her that we had a sunny, long weekend to look
  forward to and to try to think positively.

* She suggested we meditate. The focus of which, today, was about
  accepting ones lot, rather than fighting against it, for peace of
  mind. Ironically, XXX didn't seem to take this message onboard and
  became increasingly depressed. As such, I calmly tried to help her. I
  listened to what she had to say, didn't say anything she was doing was
  wrong and, I feel, was generally supportive. Of course, clearly she
  didn't think so -- I honestly can't say why; presumably because she
  didn't listen to a word I said -- and felt I was trying to undermine
  her to say that she was wrong. Nothing could have been further from
  the truth and, indeed, I said the opposite several times to cover
  myself.

* She kept coming back to the flaws in the analogies I was making.
  Analogies are flawed by their nature; they exist to highlight a
  certain point. For her, those flaws were enough to attack me on.
  Frankly, I was rather upset about this: I had been trying hard, for
  some time, to help her; I said and did all the right things --
  providing one doesn't want to split hairs over the finer points of
  semantics -- but even this wasn't enough. I let her know that it was
  unfair, but kept calm as to not blow what was happening into a fight.

* Eventually she beseeched upon me that it was my responsibility to make
  active steps into us moving out. She also reiterated that I would be
  doing the gardening on Monday, whether I wanted to or not. She didn't
  seem to believe that she needed to contribute at all because,
  apparently, all her energy is going into keeping herself afloat. Fair
  enough, but where do you think all my energy is going? Outside of my
  job, it's looking after her and trying to keep up with her relentless
  demands and insecurities.

* Don't get me wrong, I'm sympathetic to her problems and it is harder
  to help oneself than it may appear; but don't attack the person who's
  trying to help. The evening continued like this: us looking at rental
  property in XXX, with the occasional disagreement in which she
  baselessly insisted she was right (I didn't argue, obviously).

* I ask myself two questions: "Am I happy?" and "What am I getting out
  of this?" The answer to the first has been "No" for some time; we have
  fun occasionally, but they're balanced by blistering pain. As for the
  second, I always felt the answer to that was "Not much" or "nothing
  more than a pet would provide". Now we have a pet, that's been proven
  true and, in reality, the answer is more like "Less than nothing",
  given how much I give against how much she takes. Why do I persist?
  Maybe renting and selling our place will take away enough impediments
  for me to do the right thing.

## Wednesday, 2nd May, 2018

* There was a lot of tension today, but fortunately it didn't really
  escalate into a fight (largely through my finesse). I'm not sure what
  the cause was, but it got particularly heated when it was time to
  drive her to XXX. She didn't tell me when exactly she needed to be
  there, despite me asking several times -- because the same thing
  happened last week -- and then we were all in a rush to leave.

* She asked me in the car, "What is your plan for my lunch?" I misheard
  her, thinking she was asking me what I would do for lunch -- I had
  reasonably assumed that she could take care of her own lunch -- but
  apparently it was up to me to solve this for her, despite the complete
  lack of information. Fortunately that was satisfied relatively easily,
  but it's worth documenting the unreasonable expectation.

* When we returned home, I was told that I would be spending the bank
  holiday working on the garden. I knew better than to argue or to
  comment on what exactly she would be doing to tidy up our house for
  sale. I'm not sure her playing XXX all weekend will increase its
  value.

* Because we left in a hurry at lunchtime, I gave too much hay to XXX,
  which he subsequently wasted. This always annoys XXX because she
  thinks he's selectively eating. (I didn't point out the hypocrisy in
  her spending a lot of time cherry-picking the bits he likes and
  hand-feeding them to him.) Her response was to limit his nuggets and
  be generally indifferent towards him. I see what she's trying to do,
  but I don't know if it had the effect she wanted; although I'm
  somewhat glad that XXX effectively took her ire, rather than me (not
  that either of us deserved it). Of course, after a bit of time, she
  began feeling guilty about her punishment and relaxed it somewhat,
  diluting whatever lesson it was supposed to teach even more.

## Post-Holiday: Friday, 20th April -- 23rd April, 2018

* There has been no conflict since returning from holiday, but I thought
  it was worth documenting some observations. It seems clear to me that
  disagreements escalate into arguments (or worse) when one or both of
  us are tired, stressed and/or uncompromising. The last one is an
  exception: when we have very strong opinions on something, it causes
  us to be stubborn and it usually yields to conflict. The other two are
  due to external factors and are much more common. Perhaps this is a
  reason why I haven't just given up: I know that, when things are going
  well, we're generally good together. I have noticed this in the past,
  but it's difficult to be mindful of it in light of compressing
  conditions that one has no/little control over. I don't know to what
  extent XXX realises this or how much she's trying to accommodate it.
  It does seem that she's very fragile to external factors and,
  anecdotally, I know her to be more on the individualistic side.

* That said, there have been a few opinions that ought to be shared and
  summarised:

    * XXX's encouraging about me starting cycling again, and supportive
      of my apprehensions, but later realised that it would
      inconvenience her so back-peddled. This forces me to join a gym
      (which I've done, at work) and cycle at antisocial times (e.g., I
      could get up really early).

    * She approves that I talked to my parents about acquiring more
      money to fund her housing requirements; I didn't go into the
      details about how I felt when discussing it with them, the nuances
      of the "negotiations", or my parents' opinions (reasonably echoing
      mine of managing her expectations or contributing with a
      non-trivial salary of her own). However, she continues to push on
      the subject and considers my grandparents' assets up-for-grabs; I
      believe there will come a time when she'll also pressure me to
      cash in any share I have, which I don't presume I have nor
      deserve.

    * She has double standards when it comes to expenses. I am forbidden
      to mention the cost of anything (technically, in a negative way,
      but for safety it's easier for me just to avoid the subject
      altogether). I am also pushed to save money when I can. She on the
      other hand expects the freedom to mention how expensive things I
      may do are (when they're really not) while spending money with
      impunity.

    * While cleaning and playing with XXX, she often complains if/when I
      do the slightest thing wrong (in her opinion). For example, when I
      accidentally brushed her foot slightly while sweeping. She has at
      least learnt to move more out of my way while I'm cleaning up
      (albeit not completely), but I don't feel it is fair to criticise
      me while I'm working hard and she's playing.

    * While she hasn't accused me of being impatient for some time, it's
      quite obvious just how impatient she is herself. Things need to be
      done when she says and anything outside her schedule is met with
      increasing annoyance.

    * Repeatedly scheduling me into doing chores and expecting me to
      just get them done and be fine with it. Some of these she couldn't
      do herself, but there are plenty she could or -- even better --
      learn to do herself. I don't argue because it's just easier for me
      to do it, but I don't see why she doesn't understand how valuable
      my limited time is to me. Why should I spend my leisure time
      cleaning the bathroom (which is mostly caused by her) while she,
      for example, plays XXX?

    * At best, managing (at worst, restricting) access to my parents.

* I like to think of myself as an easy-going person. I'm not 100%
  convinced this is an accurate portrayal -- e.g., it's true that I like
  things to be in their place, etc. but then I wouldn't say I ever push
  to get my way -- but it's close enough. I also believe XXX is very
  high-maintenance and that our differences (such as those above, not to
  mention the less-trivial ones) breed contempt. However, I'm forgiving
  and passive, so it's clear how/why XXX maintains her attitude and
  expectations; one might even argue that it's my fault.

## Tuesday, 17th April, 2018

* I was asked to hold XXX's jacket, which I did without complaint. (I
  had already mentioned that she didn't need it, as it was so hot, but
  that's not important.) I had also been carrying her water for much of
  the morning. I wouldn't say I complained about it, but I may have
  mentioned something. I believe (although I definitely didn't say this)
  that one needs to be responsible for themselves; asking for help is
  fine, but it shouldn't be expected, especially when it's not needed.
  (It's also worth pointing out that at the same time, I really needed
  to use the bathroom and was "encouraged" to find somewhere else; this
  put me into a somewhat painful and stressed condition, but it was
  effectively my choice.) This led to a bit of a tiff, as I exaggerated
  about the level of support I was providing, which we resolved
  relatively quickly by sitting it out in a cool setting.

* In the evening, XXX accidentally caused my bathroom towel to fall onto
  the wet bathroom floor. Rather than pick it up immediately -- because
  it was probably fine, but her aversion to anything touching the floor
  changes things -- she threw it out. This clearly inconvenienced me and
  I had to call the reception for a replacement. It was a trivial
  problem, with no one to blame, but it led to me being forced to solve
  it, which I complained -- albeit, in my opinion, to about the same
  level as the problem itself; that is, trivially.

* With the previous exaggeration and this new complaint, XXX erupted
  into a conflict where I was, apparently, being unfairly negative and
  pinning all the blame on her. I was rather taken aback, to be honest,
  and tried to defend my position. Needless to say, it didn't work and
  just made things worse. Eventually I managed to convince her that I
  wasn't blaming her and -- in future -- I wouldn't exaggerate, if I
  could help it. If I can, I'll actually do more than that and just not
  mention anything negative, seeing as she's so hypersensitive to such
  things!

* To be clear though, exaggeration is clearly a signal that someone
  wants to highlight something -- in this case, the fact that I was
  doing something for her out of kindness, that she could (and probably
  should) have easily done herself -- and complaining is a way of
  communicating one's lack of power to resolve. Her argument was that
  complaining is annoying and that the complainer should think of
  others; mine was that, while it's annoying at a pathological scale, a
  better way of dealing with such people is to listen and support them,
  rather than push them back. She even used a good analogy (alcoholism),
  but had the same compassionless conclusion.

## Tuesday, 10th April, 2018

* I avoided the conflict, but XXX was very short tempered today,
  probably due to tiredness. It all came to a head when we were dealing
  with XXX: everything I did was wrong. I was either using too much
  kitchen towel and not enough wood shavings, or too many wood shavings;
  apparently this is wasteful. Personally, I think XXX's health is worth
  the few pence that they cost. Perhaps, as she's such an expert on
  looking after him, maybe she should do something other than sitting in
  my way and barking orders while I'm crawling around cleaning him out.

* On a possibly related note, I've been feeling increasingly unwell
  lately. It's not surprising, with the stress of satisfying XXX's
  unreasonable constraints, lack of sleep from all the extra activities
  we're doing (which includes extra work for me) and less-than-healthy
  food from all the eating out we're doing. I'm worried that our
  holiday, next week, will be -- at best -- like Brighton.

## Sunday, 8th April, 2018

* After Thursday's meltdown, I didn't have high expectations for the
  weekend. However, after XXX submitted her draft XXX, on Friday, she
  was suddenly significantly happier. The cooking I spent all afternoon
  preparing went down well and then we went to the XXX thing in the
  evening. The weekend also wasn't too bad; although I was still very
  tired and, obviously, emotionally drained and heartbroken, inside.

* Finally, after having a relatively convivial weekend, she got upset at
  me when I changed the sheets and didn't wash my hands to her
  specifications. She wasn't very clear what she wanted -- and, frankly,
  I didn't see the point -- but, amazingly, it didn't come to much.

## Thursday, 5th April, 2018

* Suffering from increasingly little sleep, while I'm trying to satisfy
  all of XXX's constraints, I mentioned during dinner that our going out
  regime was getting a little expensive. I did not mean it as a
  criticism at all, just as a fact that, perhaps, we should pare back
  just a little. Of course, had I been fully awake, I probably wouldn't
  have said such a thing at all -- despite its truth -- or at least
  phrased it in a completely disinterested was. Alas, I didn't and all
  hell broke loose.

* First came the shouting, which she insisted wasn't the case. It got
  louder and louder until I snapped. Realising my mistake, I had
  remained relatively calm -- if not a bit passive -- up until that
  point.  In fact, because I was so tired and stressed by what she's
  putting me through, I started crying and shaking while trying to tidy
  up in the kitchen. The shouting continued and then, when I pulled
  myself together, I said, "If you shout at me again, I'm out of here".
  It wasn't particularly loud, but it was quite assertive by my
  standards.

* Of course, XXX can dish it out, but she can't take it herself. She
  retaliated by saying that she would leave; which she did. She got
  dressed and prepared to storm out of the house. Given it was dark and
  cold and that she had nowhere to go, I starting putting my shoes on so
  I could follow her, to make sure she was safe. She was furious at this
  point; blinded by incandescent rage. As we walked through XXX, she
  shouted many times, "Stop following me!" and "Don't touch me!" when I
  tried to comfort her. I'm not completely stupid: I kept my distance,
  but kept trying to reason with her.

* She stormed off through XXX, across the bridge and into XXX. She
  shouted at least once, that she just wanted to kill herself. I kept
  talking to her, to try to calm her down.  Eventually, we came to the
  end of the path and she stopped.

* After about 10-20 minutes of negotiation and her yelling at me, I
  convinced her at least to come home, out of the cold, and that killing
  herself wasn't going to solve anything. I was freezing at this point,
  not to mention incredibly upset. She said many, many upsetting and
  false things during her little rampage -- such as me valuing money
  more than her -- and frankly, at this point, I regard her treatment of
  me as emotional abuse.

* When we got home, she went to the bathroom or to play XXX (I honestly
  don't remember, I was so upset), while I continued to clean up after
  dinner. Afterwards she came down, still angry, but at least composed
  and not yelling. She still wanted to leave, still misunderstanding
  what I said. I said that if she wanted to leave, she could; I was calm
  about it and didn't say anything to, in my opinion, make her feel
  guilty. I did mention that it was less than ideal to rush into such a
  big decision and forsake all with been through so hastily, but that
  didn't matter.

* When I thought it was all over, she mentioned that she'd take XXX with
  her. To be honest, by then and given what's been happening
  increasingly over these past months, I was resigned to that (if not
  unhappy about it). However, her taking custody of XXX didn't sit right
  with me. She wanted him, sure, but I've invested at least as much into
  his welfare as she has. Plus, she can barely take care of herself
  without a team of servants; she does a good job of XXX when it's easy,
  but I'd be worried for his wellbeing if she were to do it alone. I
  made one last effort to make up and it worked. I did it for XXX.

* (Part of me believes that the only reason XXX wanted a rabbit so badly
  is to make me compliant in such events; to use him as a bargaining
  chip. I have no evidence for that, but given what she says and how she
  thinks of me, I wouldn't be surprised.)

* At 5am, she came into my room and woke me up; upset again. She kept
  repeating, over and over, "Why are you doing this to me?" in an
  increasingly pathetic voice. Obviously she still believed I was
  intentionally harming her. I understand that she's going through a
  difficult time with her XXX -- although I wasn't aware just how close
  it was to being drafted -- but that's not my fault. I have worked so
  hard and suffered through so much of her shit to keep her content, but
  all she sees are my faults. It's horrific what I have to put up with.
  I eventually brought her around; she wasn't happy, but at least we
  could go back to sleep.

* On Friday morning, things were obviously still tense. By in large, I
  kept my distance -- I agreed, as I thought it would help, to take the
  day off as sick -- and that mostly worked. Still, again she made me
  promise -- and again this almost came to blows -- to talk to my
  parents about them giving/lending us money to pay for a better-located
  house.  I'm just sick of this shit, by now, so I just agreed in a calm
  voice and went about my afternoon cooking. Just doing whatever she
  asks keeps her quiet, but that's no fun for me.

## Easter Weekend: Friday, 30th March -- Monday, 2nd April, 2018

* No specific conflict arose during this long weekend, but there were a
  few tense moments. For example, when I used the bathroom for a while
  without first giving her the option to use it: this is something she
  often does to me (admittedly, less so nowadays); I guess if I ever get
  colon cancer, we'll know who to blame. Similarly, I was pushed into
  doing things I didn't particularly want to, such as housework or being
  her umbrella-lackie -- which she could have easily done/helped with,
  herself -- when I'd rather relax over the weekend. Even doing anything
  that I would like is off limits. For example, I find it hard to find
  the time to call my parents, these days; in fact, it was mentioned
  that "we could visit them sometime in the summer", like I have to ask
  permission! Not to mention the fact that I actually found something
  fun and interesting for us to do later in the year -- something XXX
  often does and encourages me to do too, as if I didn't have enough to
  do -- but this was rejected on the grounds of cost (yes, seriously).

* Anyway, no fights manifested themselves, but that's only due to my
  handling of the situation. That is, I just took it and accepted the
  situation -- whether it was fair or not -- and tried to do/predict
  what she wanted. This is not a healthy solution and I'm now far from
  happy, but I guess that's the just the way it's going to be. I'm too
  much of a coward to do anything about it.

## Wednesday, 28th March, 2018

* Once again, the subject of our living arrangements came up and how,
  apparently, my parents are expected to at least help finance it. I
  maintain that, while my parents may well help us out, they have no
  obligation to and are certainly not bound to match her parents'
  financial assistance. If XXX's parents kindly give us XXX towards a
  housing upgrade, how on earth does it follow that my parents should
  match that? Don't get me wrong: XXX's parents' offer and support is
  very kind and, if anything, overly generous, but it's unreasonable to
  expect reciprocation from a third-party.

* Anyway, while maintaining my position, I kept very calm and this
  helped quell any excitement from XXX's side. I said I would ask my
  parents about how much they could offer, subtly -- and was also
  required to give a timeframe -- but insisted that she not set her
  hopes too high. This seemed to be enough, but obviously I am far from
  happy about this.

* I should add that XXX's expectation as to the source of said money
  would be from the sale of grandma's house. I pointed out that we
  already received our inheritance early from grandma (I would go as far
  as saying it was extorted out of her) and that, again, we have no
  right to additional funds simply by virtue of being related. A more
  realistic option would be for XXX to take a job that paid a salary
  comparable to mine -- you know, like normal people -- rather than
  expecting money to fall from the sky with no strings attached.

## Friday, 23rd March, 2018

* No conflict has occurred yet, but I mistakenly thought XXX was going
  to XXX early last night and prepared everything for a (relatively)
  early start. While I was cleaning out XXX, in the morning, it occurred
  to me that, as term had ended, she probably doesn't need to go so
  early. I hadn't been told otherwise, but I panicked! If I woke her up
  now, that would really go against me. As she hadn't got up -- and is
  usually good at getting herself up, especially when her alarm is going
  off -- I thought I'd let her sleep and work from home in the morning.

* This proved to be the correct decision. However, she's clearly more
  tired than normal and that is genuinely my fault. I apologised, of
  course, but I worry that this will flare up into a full blown fight at
  some point in the near future. I hope I'm wrong.

* (Post-weekend update: I wouldn't say I was wrong, but no fight
  occurred. However, I went to a lot of trouble to keep her happy and
  avoid any potential for an argument at all costs. This basically meant
  doing everything she said and appearing happy about it. It was
  exhausting.)

## Sunday, 18th March, 2018 (+Early Monday Morning)

* Everything was going so well until after we had lunch. We went out to
  a pub in XXX, which was good; then I wanted to go shopping afterwards
  because we didn't have any food for the coming week. We had planned on
  going to XXX, but XXX wasn't feeling 100% so we changed to XXX; that
  was fully booked, so XXX it was. Given the original plan and that XXX
  is also pretty convenient, I planned on going to Tesco on the way back
  to get the grocery shopping.  Of course, coincidentally, this is
  exactly the same moment as XXX started suffering from debilitating
  period cramps.

* Of course, this meant that going to Tesco was the wrong decision. She
  had said she wanted to go to Morrison's earlier -- which is closer to
  home -- but their produce is kind of rubbish and I thought that I
  could get everything we needed for the whole week and not have to
  worry about shopping again. Apparently, XXX had different ideas: In
  the end, I only got the minimal amount of shopping needed, to get her
  home, and keep us going until we can go to Morrison's again on Tuesday
  evening.

* Once home, playing with XXX did smooth her out a bit. However, it
  wasn't long before the tension exploded once again. After dinner --
  bearing in mind, by this point, I had fixed the vacuum cleaner, done
  the vacuuming and cooked 5 meals -- she wanted to play XXX, whereas I
  wanted to chill out a bit. That set her off: she'd been watching TV
  all afternoon, in her convalescence, so wanted do something more
  interesting. Fair enough, but what about me? Eventually this grew into
  an argument about not going to Tesco and doing something more
  interesting in the evenings; the crux being (I learnt later) that she
  thought nothing had changed and we were slipping into our old routine.

* I tried to reason with her: Tesco was convenient at the time and
  generally better; we'd had a good day and indeed a fun and interesting
  weekend (I didn't mention how much it was costing; in fact, she
  brought it up); that we have XXX to play with. I conceded to playing
  XXX. That -- and XXX -- seemed to keep her quiet.

* However, she didn't sleep well overnight. So she woke me up at around
  6am to have a tantrum (this is when I learnt the actual nature of the
  problem). Normally, I wouldn't have minded this, but she insisted that
  her state was because of me forcing my schedule/routine upon her. This
  isn't true at all and, again, I reiterated what I had said the
  previous evening. I remained cool and tried not to take it personally,
  despite the very obvious attack, at least not outwardly. Eventually,
  she calmed down enough and I managed to lie in bed for another hour,
  getting me off to a bad start for the rest of the week.

* As I say, I don't mind helping her when she feels anxious -- even if
  that manifests itself as a tantrum in the early morning. What bothers
  me is how it's not only directed at me, but also takes me as culpable.
  I'm sorry that her XXX seems like a looming chore and I'm sorry that
  her period pain is so bad, but it's not my fault. Life goes on and
  it's up to me to hold everything together, which I'm doing pretty well
  given the circumstances, but it necessarily involves a certain amount
  of give from her (which obviously she's not willing).

* Also, while I wouldn't understand, I feel that if ones period pain is
  that debilitating, one should see a specialist about it. I can't
  suffer from it, so I can only imagine, but I've known more than one
  woman in my lifetime. While I haven't been close enough to any to know
  the details, I've objectively witnessed that half of the adult
  population aren't completely incapacitated for a week every month.
  It's also surprisingly coincidental with things she doesn't want to
  do; just saying.

## Thursday, 15th March, 2018

* After returning from the hospital, I was met by the usual
  "decontamination protocol", which I reasonably objected to. XXX
  believes that everything I touched, while I was at the hospital, needs
  to be disinfected. This involved me standing out in the rain while she
  attended to the soles of my shoes. This happens every time I go to the
  hospital. I tried to avoid it this time round by not letting her know
  the exact date and going later in the day, but they change my
  appointment so often and it's a regular thing (so difficult to hide),
  that it was a losing battle.

* Maybe I shouldn't have been so dismissive about her requirement for
  this, but I was tired and getting wet. It's not exactly nice for me to
  go to the hospital, to confront this thing that I have and my own
  mortality, and to be met with such ridiculousness is too much.

* She insisted that she didn't want to get up early to do this (it
  wasn't that early: I get up earlier than that every day), although
  it's clearly her choice. She got louder and louder and even shouted
  something like, "I'm doing all this hard work when I'm grumpy and
  tired and you're still not happy." Once again, the irony in this
  statement is tragic. I wonder how she would react if I shouted at her
  every time she takes the chores I do (that is, hours of work every
  single day) for granted?

* We're going out later -- again, I was forced to take the afternoon off
  as annual leave -- mainly to pick up our bunny. I'm not sure a bunny,
  any amount of meditation, afternoon teas, theatre visits or meals out
  is going to save things.

* Indeed, we first went to XXX (en route to the bunny), where she was
  extremely impatient because we got there just before closing time and
  the National Trust people were quite talkative. She jack booted up to
  the house while I sorted out the tickets; she was so incensed with
  getting there in a hurry, she didn't even realise when she had passed
  the entrance and could calm down! Afterwards, while she didn't give me
  a hard time about it (surprisingly), she mentioned that she doesn't
  want us to get Gift Aid tickets in future; confirming with me that she
  only really cares about herself.

* Fortunately, our bunny seems to have smoothed her mood out somewhat.
  However -- and I realise I'm anthropomorphising, somewhat -- I feel
  sorry for him: He's really cute, but we tore him from his mother into
  an unusual environment. I'll do my best to look after him and keep him
  healthy and happy.

## Monday, 12th March, 2018

* Reporting back: As I suspected, the tension over our holiday could
  have been cut with a knife. Tempers flared up several times, but I
  managed to keep her under control by basically agreeing to everything,
  no matter how unreasonable. It was hard work and, while it had its
  moments, it didn't feel like much of a holiday to me.

## Friday, 9th March, 2018

* It had all been going so well: no arguments or fights for over a week
  and both of us generally being high spirited and loving towards each
  other. In fact, I was almost tempted to remove my remarks about it
  being the end; thinking that maybe there was some other hidden cause
  of the tensions between us (e.g., my work). However, when I greeted
  her at the end of the day, it was immediately clear that all was not
  well.

* No arguments or conflicts occurred during the evening, but the tension
  has been palpable. There were several close calls, that I avoided
  (e.g., her talking about pay gap statistics and me being of the
  opinion that, despite it being true, that the reality is probably more
  nuanced than the numbers suggest -- of course, my opinion didn't
  matter, because I'm a man). I can see that a fight is very likely in
  the next few days: the worst timing, while we're on holiday. I'll do
  my best to do/predict her every requirement -- no matter how
  outlandish or unreasonable -- even doing so with a happy face (just
  like her dad does with her mum!), but I won't hold my breath… I'll get
  back to you.

## Weekend: Saturday, 3rd March -- Sunday, 4th March, 2018

* It is notable that this is the first weekend, I think, this year that
  has gone by without an argument. However, I had to be quite careful
  about what I said and did. Specifically submitting to being told to
  clean the bathroom and that, for example, I should take three weeks
  holiday next (and every) winter so she can avoid the short daylight
  hours, regardless of how difficult this would be for me. I'm happy to
  help and I'm sure some compromise can be met, but it's not fair that
  the onus is entirely upon me. The problem is, I can't talk to her or
  rationalise with her that this is unsustainable, etc. without it
  causing yet another enduring argument.

## Thursday, 1st March, 2018

* Forced to take the afternoon off (annual leave)

* We got into a slight misunderstanding at the end of what was a pretty
  good day regarding her requirements for Friday. I was trying to assert
  that I can't make absolute promises because there are external factors
  at play that I have no control over. That's true, but it was the wrong
  approach and that was my fault; but I meant nothing by it. Fortunately
  we resolved this fairly easily.

## Saturday, 24th February, 2018

* I asked her to close the kitchen door, as I often do, to preserve the
  heat on a cold day. I don't think I said it impatiently and I
  definitely didn't say it harshly. She snapped at me, because she felt
  I was nagging her.

* This escalated into her yelling and swearing at me in the street as we
  were walking to lunch. I apologised for what she took as nagging. (I
  really didn't mean it that way, but thought that showing some humility
  might have helped. It didn't.)

* She calmed down a bit once we got to lunch and sort-of-apologised for
  snapping, blaming it on the frustrations she's been having with XXX. I
  understand and sympathise, and wasn't in the mood for prolonging an
  already stupid fight, so just let it be and, again, tried to
  rationalise with her regarding her situation. This helped somewhat,
  but it was unfair for her to attack me in the first place.

* I also mentioned that she does the very same thing to me. Just this
  morning she asked when I was going to do the vacuuming, when she could
  quite easily do it herself rather than spending hours playing XXX.
  (Again, when we came home in the evening, she mentioned that she
  forgot to remind me to bleach the toilet. I'm not sure why she can't
  do this herself, but I didn't bite!) She almost conceded to this, but
  ultimately (and unsurprisingly) I ended up doing the vacuuming anyway.
  The irony would almost be amusing, if it weren't so tragic.

* It seems going out to look for bunnies, going out almost every other
  day, spending our (my) money like it's going out of fashion and
  meditating isn't really doing anything for XXX's "condition". I didn't
  even dare broach the subject of the large PayPal charge that appeared
  on my credit card (which I assume is her's, but it may be some dodgy
  transaction, hence needing to check) or that another work retreat has
  to be organised around her... I assume that will be the subject of the
  next fight.

* (Amazingly, it didn't turn into a fight. I must have phrased it
  particularly well. The retreat topic was less well received, but I
  managed to allay her fears.)

## Thursday, 22nd February, 2018

* Forced to take the afternoon off (annual leave)

## Saturday, 17th February, 2018

* Overnight, XXX insisted that we didn't sleep apart, so that she could
  get over her fear. That's obviously fine, but of course I wasn't
  allowed to move. Whenever we talked about anything, it was just fuel
  for more arguing. Eventually, since she kept going to the bathroom, I
  was allowed to return to my room.

* Still, if yesterday wasn't bad enough, today things went
  thermonuclear. Apparently, to get over that I said the cupboard was
  haunted, she needs a rabbit. The idea being that this would help with
  the loneliness and also take her mind off things regarding any
  potential poltergeists. However, XXX has very low standards (in my
  opinion) of animal welfare: Not only did she want to spontaneously buy
  a bunny, without any foreknowledge of how to look after it, but also
  to keep it in a cage. Indoors.

* Don't get me wrong, XXX's welfare is important and I think having a
  pet might help, but dismissing yourself of all responsibility is
  borderline cruel. I didn't use such strong language, obviously, but I
  made it clear that this wasn't a good idea. Maybe I should have said
  that it would be better if she were better prepared, or less
  spontaneous. Never mind, the damage is done. She started screaming at
  the top of her voice and throwing things around in the bathroom. She
  was in such a blind rage, that she sliced her had with whatever it was
  she was throwing. I was worried that I would be the next thing to
  suffer, but fortunately not.

* After her tantrum, she said she was getting a bunny whether I liked it
  or not. By this point, I was incredulous and weirdly calm; like it was
  clear that everything had failed and this final act was the
  vindication of that.

* Anyway, we obviously went to the pet shop and, amazingly, I managed to
  convince her that we shouldn't get a bunny immediately. XXX wanted to
  adopt quite a cute little bunny, there-and-then, but also wanted to go
  out in the evening. Her plan was that the bunny could just wait in the
  car while we had dinner. I don't know what the hell she was thinking,
  but she conceded to just getting the cage (a big one: I'm not letting
  a bunny be mistreated on my watch) and bedding, etc. and waiting for
  the bunny when we were ready, a day-or-so later.

* There were still arguments, to come. Apparently I had a long face.
  Really? Do you really think this is a normal situation and that I
  should be perfectly fine with your incessant and increasingly insane
  requests? The Chinese Food Festival we went to was mired in this, but
  otherwise sucked; I had lost my appetite at this point, anyway. I
  might as well give up.

## Friday, 16th February, 2018

* While not a conflict, per se, I joked with XXX that a ghost had made
  something fall out of the wardrobe. Apparently this was enough to
  scare her and she was clearly annoyed with me; making the drive to XXX
  unnecessarily tense.

* Unfortunately, as I anticipated, this eventually turned into a huge
  fight in the evening. Possibly the most ridiculous in human history: I
  joked that the cupboard was haunted, thus triggering her up-until-now
  unknown phobias of ghosts and, apparently, cupboards (I'm not making
  this up). Eventually, she [tenuously] connected this to negative
  thoughts about the house and how we should move out.

* The ridiculousness of it all turned me off completely. I was at points
  completely unable to respond; flabbergasted by how stupid this was.
  Again, to calm her down -- her being in this extreme state does
  nothing to help her -- I just ended up agreeing to whatever mad thing
  she came up with.

* Other highlights include: She's been anxious about me reaching some
  threshold regarding our current spending, whereas, actually, I've been
  trying very hard to meet her requests with positivity. Apparently my
  fear of heights/whatever is equally ridiculous: It's true that my
  phobias are as irrational as anyone else's, but they're things that
  are at least grounded in reality. Ghosts aren't a thing, etc., etc.

* To ease her anxiety about moving out of our house, I have to spend the
  very little remaining free time I have left starting to pack my
  things. At this point, I don't think there's any worry about me not
  doing that. It's over.

## Sunday, 11th February, 2018

* We almost got though a whole weekend without an argument. However, it
  was too good to be true.

* Noticed throughout the day that XXX was short tempered (e.g., at
  lunch, she was annoyed about how the food was ordered). This piqued
  while I was driving and came across as impatient; this was my fault,
  but I was trying to drive in a difficult situation and being asked
  irrelevant questions.

* Things simmered down until the very end of the day, when suddenly XXX
  decided she wanted to go out again on Monday. She didn't consider the
  difficulties this would cause, let alone the additional expense. (I
  didn't mention the latter because, while it's completely factual that
  we're burning through money like it's going out of fashion with this
  new lifestyle, I've learned that bringing this up makes things even
  worse.)

* The difficulties came around rescheduling the laundry, dinner and my
  working. All relatively trivial things that, I believed for a few
  moments, we solved together perfectly. However, when I reasonably
  asked her to help -- which apparently came across as impatient --
  everything erupted. Apparently she wanted me to do everything, exactly
  how she said, without her involvement.

* It ultimately became clear to me, while I was being shouted at, that
  something else was wrong. I managed to calm XXX down and rationalise
  with her, to an extent, although without absolving myself apparently.
  Again, she started blaming her PMS and work schedule -- at least, the
  anticipation of these, as they're both at least a week away -- as well
  as her bad back.

* Things seemed settled, eventually, but clearly a low mood persisted
  'til morning (where I went to work late, waiting for her). She also
  sent me a text message, while I was asleep, explaining exactly how she
  expects the laundry to be done.

## Saturday, 3rd February, 2018

* Forced to wash jeans.

* That's not what I had a problem with -- I couldn't really care less
  about washing my jeans -- but they didn't need washing at all. It was
  clear that I had to do what she said and that's what caused the
  argument.

* I was unable to undo the precedent, but dealt with it personally in a
  way that let us get on with our day.

* Later, however, I was annoyed for external reasons. XXX kindly tried
  to talk me out of it, but when it came to voicing my opinion on what I
  was thinking, this was seen harshly (i.e., "my opinion is wrong" and
  "you're mean to think that", etc.) This isn't what I'd class as a
  conflict, but it's just another example of me being undermined.

## Saturday, 27th January, 2018

* Objected to me changing her bedding, even though it had been two weeks
  since it had last been washed.

* I wanted to do it because there was a lot of laundry to do and its
  easiest to wash bedding altogether first thing in the morning.

* XXX saw my request as overly specific/inflexible, even though it was
  beneficial to her and -- had she not interfered -- not even have
  involved her.

## Thursday, 25th January, 2018

* Forced to take the day off (annual leave)

* When trying to help, I was blamed for not saying exactly the right
  thing or saying what she wanted to hear. I put an end to this conflict
  as quickly as possible, because it did nothing to help XXX's state at
  the time, but I maintain that I was just trying to help and that one
  can't expect very specific counsel. Moreover, if she had let me
  finish/listened to what I was trying to say, before overreacting, she
  would have understood my point (as she did when I eventually managed
  to say it uninterrupted).

## Sunday, 21st January, 2018

* Spilled over from previous night. Apparently XXX was up in the night
  and that was the fault of dinner being 30 minutes later than she would
  have liked. I don't think digestive systems work like that.

* Argument moved once again to us moving to XXX and her requirement on
  me to encourage this idea, even though it puts me at a disadvantage. I
  could only offer conditional encouragement and, of course, that wasn't
  enough.

* The conflict again moved to the subject of parental financial support.
  I don't understand why she believes money should just be bestowed upon
  you without having to earn it and that, if one side of the family
  offers, the other is expected to reciprocate in kind. Who puts so much
  stock in their parents when they're in their 30s?

## Saturday, 20th January, 2018

* After spending 2hrs cleaning the house and 1.5hrs making dinner, it
  was served later than I had wanted; at 8:15pm. During this time, XXX
  played XXX.

* Because it was after the 7:45-8pm maximum window, this resulted in a
  huge argument about how I should have scheduled things differently, so
  we could have dinner early.

* For example, me shaving on a different day or using a different
  method, vacuuming the house later or on a different day, etc. It's
  worth mentioning that I always try to shave on a Saturday and like to
  do the housework all in one day, because I deserve a day off. Let's
  also not forget that I said in the morning that I had a lot to get
  done today; XXX added the additional requirement of going out to do
  not very much at all. I compromised for doing that (after all, she
  wouldn't have accepted a "no"), even to the extent of rushing the
  shopping (most of which was for her).

* The argument escalated, as they do. The fact that I spent all
  afternoon doing housework was overlooked. XXX did mention that she
  could help, but that her back hurt: Maybe if she did housework, she
  wouldn't be so weak and I wouldn't be reluctant to ask her to help
  because (a) it wouldn't be a waste of my time and (b) it wouldn't take
  longer to teach her how, e.g., the vacuum cleaner works than it would
  for me to do it myself.

* The argument inevitably came around to her "going crazy" living in XXX
  and that we have to move out, to wherever she wants, pressurising my
  parents (and hers) to help us financially, as soon as possible.  (Even
  under the threat of violent retribution: "I'll go Bunny-Smash on
  whoever doesn't help.") I didn't take the bait and this element of the
  conflict fortunately didn't last long.

* However, when I was thinking that all was said and done, XXX mentioned
  that my attitude towards the professional XXX players she was watching
  earlier had undermined her (unsurprisingly, she didn't see the
  hypocrisy in this). Again, I maintained that I'm entitled to an
  opinion and sharing that opinion does not mean it applied to her. How
  she extrapolated that, I'll never know.

* Eventually she started blaming her PMS; not that it would have avoided
  the argument, but it may have taken the edge off. I would say that PMS
  is not an excuse to be awful to people. A quarter of women aren't
  completely dysfunctional at any one time.

* Again, eventually, I managed to calm her down and engaged us in some
  silly activities to alleviate our frayed nerves.

## Wednesday, 17th January, 2018

* Forced to take the day off (annual leave)

## Sunday, 14th January, 2018

* Generally a fine day, with a high degree of cooperation

* Suddenly, XXX's mood changed drastically when we were at the garden
  centre

* Everything was wrong, including my opinions. Again, where we live came
  up; how the Sunday closing laws are inconvenient for her; how we're
  not doing anything/enough to entertain her, or what we do, I mention
  about being overly expensive (which I haven't since the previous
  week's argument: see 7/1/2018), which deflates her mood further

* A lot of suggestions later, I managed to come up with something that
  calmed her down

## Saturday, 13th January, 2018

* XXX had a rough night and so was in a low mood

* I tried a lot and in a friendly way to help her; I seemed to be making
  progress

* I suggested that, while her short term fix was fine, a longer term
  solution would be advisable

* Whilst I said this multiple times, I did not force this upon her, it
  was a merely a suggestion to aid her recovery

* It wasn't taken like that and her low mood turned hostile

* She asked me to take Wednesday off and I said I would try, but
  couldn't promise anything

* She reacted by repeatedly screaming, at the top of her voice, that
  this condition must be satisfied

* I calmly mentioned her reaction was not fair, but I'd do everything I
  could to help

* The argument persisted, despite this. She crossed the line by
  suggesting that it's my/my parents' fault for living in XXX because
  I/they couldn't match her parent's financial assistance; she made a
  weird argument that "middle class people should be able to afford such
  things". At this point, I had given up trying to reason with her.

## Wednesday, 10th January, 2018

* I had a really bad day at work; XXX had a rough night and so was in a
  low mood

* Apparently my low mood was a trigger for her and that was my fault

* I maintained that I'm entitled to my feelings, but it just made things
  worse

* Ultimately, support against my bad day was omitted and I had to deal
  with her

## Sunday, 7th January, 2018

* Went out to XXX for lunch

* I mentioned that lunch was rather expensive (not what I was expecting
  for lunch, but fine because we had a smaller dinner)

* This completely changed her mood, in that she saw my comment as
  complaining and dampening spirits

* She also insisted that I shouldn't have a drink if I think it's
  expensive. I was paying for us, was thirsty and even had a headache.
  My comment was just that, not a criticism or complaint

* She was clearly angry thereafter (e.g., slamming doors, etc.), but I
  eventually managed to calm her down by suggesting a seafood restaurant
  she might like to try

## Saturday, 6th January, 2018

* Details forgotten, but something triggered an argument at lunch/just
  before we started playing a XXX

## Inbetween

* Details forgotten; I'm quite sure some disagreement occurred in this
  period

## Christmas, 2017

* Told to drive unhurriedly, adding 30-40 minutes to the journey and
  stimulating my hip problem

* Generally kept to ourselves or played with the kids and everything was
  fine; there were no issues with M&D (as I suspected)

* XXX took rather more than her fair share, at dinner, and ultimately
  didn't eat it all

* We checked in at the hotel and were there for a rather drawn out
  period

* On the way back, she had a massive go at me because the car was too
  dusty for her and I should have cleaned it
