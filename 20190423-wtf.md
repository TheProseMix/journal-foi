# Easter Weekend, 2019

* Saturday
  * XXX meltdown
    * "classy"
    * representing the countryside
* Sunday
  * "Made a mistake 8yrs ago"
  * I've actually gone to considerable length and sacrifice to move her
    to where she wants; understand what she said was out of anger, but
    doesn't appreciate what I'm doing (didn't even thank me for the
    amount of crap I had to put through regarding selling the house)
* Monday
  * End of day, trying to reason with her about unrelated thing; she
    asked my opinion and I gave it, trying to let her see the
    compromise. Ultimately failed and I gave up; just proved my point

abdominal pain; access to healthcare
manipulation through sleep depravation: XXX thing, so much tidying, she
did nothing
tidying > performance > XXX
she sleeps 'til 11

pretend; drink; indifference; safe in bed; XXX nails; pathetic (XXX);
fat; racism/hypocrisy; agency (ice cream); successful despite you

weekend: breakdown over XXX street; pathetic; using idle threat of XXX
against me

She'll be the victim

trip to XXX; went well, despite her being in a rush; thanked me for
understanding her when we got home... She doesn't understand me: no
rush, solitude, likes to help but not told what to do, etc.

got the job; everything about her

Forbidden access to healthcare

can't outsmart; secrecy

Dad: "It's tough at the top; I guess you wouldn't know."

very sad about move to XXX

n.b., period
