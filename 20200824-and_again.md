I'm not even going to bother writing what happened. I've had enough. I
said the wrong thing -- that's on me -- but it didn't have to turn into
an argument. From about 6:30pm to well past 4am, last night, with a
considerable break in the middle while XXX was in the bathroom... I just
don't care any more. I've given up. I don't have anything to lose.
