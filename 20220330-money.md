Another month, another mortgage overpayment.

The price of energy is going up, but the credit card bill was lower than
usual. (Note, as I've said before, we both consume the energy and food,
etc. bought with the credit card. I don't know why it's my
responsibility to pay it single-handedly.) Anyway, as such, I paid XXX
-- what I had left after being paid -- into the overpayment. This was
topped up with XXX from the joint account (again, which only I furnish).
XXX paid nothing.

That brings my personal contribution to overpayments to XXX, so far.
That should definitely shift the XXX:XXX split in our XXX, but of
course, that wasn't brought up. Also of course, I just paid this and
made no fuss, as I don't want to be up half the night trying to defend
myself from her fury. However, let it go on record that I am doing this
under duress. I do not consent.

Speaking of that split, XXX mentioned the balance of the money XXX gave
us as a cash incentive. Initially it was in the context of using it to
overpay, but then she asserted that it should actually just displace
part of the XXX that her parents gave her. Well, she can account for it
any way she likes, but if she does so like that, then it would change
the XXX split in my favour. "XXX" is a funny word, isn't it?

Another red flag: XXX has got herself a new bank account, for some
reason. She is interested in moving the XXX money there as it will
accrue more interest. It will also be further and further from my
(rightful) orbit. Convenient.
