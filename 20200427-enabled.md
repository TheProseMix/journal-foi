On Friday, XXX excitedly told me that her work had conceded to
rearranging her line management. I'm glad that that should, I hope, put
an end to this ridiculous saga, but I'm annoyed that, once again, her
whims have been enabled by others, thus persisting her narcissism. (I
realise I'm hardly one to talk.) I wish someone would just be firm with
her. I'd like to think she'd learn from this -- that the world doesn't
revolve around her -- but realistically, she'd probably just kick up a
fuss until the problem atrophied away.
