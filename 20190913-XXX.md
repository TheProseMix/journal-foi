XXX passed away on Wednesday night.

We gave him a wash, because he had peed himself again, after we put him
back and I had finished cleaning his hutch, he wouldn't eat and
ultimately collapsed. It was the most heartbreaking thing I think I have
ever experienced, watching the poor little guy struggle to stand, even
trying to eat, but failing. We rushed him to the animal hospital, but he
left us before we arrived.

I don't think I have ever been so sad. Likewise, XXX is just as upset.
It was all so sudden: we knew he was poorly, but didn't know how bad it
had got. I was planning on taking him to the vet next week, but I'm too
late. Now we'll never see him again.

We both miss him terribly. It's like a huge part of us has been ripped
out. We're both breaking into tears whenever we think of him. It's going
to take us a long time to be OK.

We loved you so much, XXX. We'll never forget you.
