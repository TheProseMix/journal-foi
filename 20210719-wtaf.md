This evening, she asked to talk. During which she stated that if I were
to ever physically harm her — not that I would ever do so intentionally,
but even accidentally during an argument counts — she cannot guarantee
the consequences. Those being, and I quote, she would “stab [me]” or
“kill [me] in [my] sleep.” I don’t know what to make of this. Is that a
threat? Should I be worried, or is this more of her same extreme speech?
I think it’s nonetheless pretty clear, with this and what she said about
her dad yesterday, that she has violence on the mind and even if she
doesn’t act on it, I’m more than a little concerned.
