I wish I had recorded yesterday evening's meltdown.

For the past week or so, I've been feeling increasingly guilty about my
inevitable "betrayal" because XXX and I have been getting along.
However, as I've documented in the past, this never lasts. Earlier this
week, she started getting impatient. Then, yesterday evening, she went
full-crazy.

We went shopping. Because she's super-anxious about CORVID-19, she want
us to eat more at home these days, rather than going out. That suits me:
I like to cook and three days' worth of meals cost less -- and are way
healthier -- than just one cheap meal out. During our shop, I habitually
licked my finger in order to gain better purchase on a plastic bag, for
the vegetables. She went fucking nuts.

Honestly, I have lost the strength to describe these infractions. What's
the point. She'll be the death of me; not some stupid virus.
